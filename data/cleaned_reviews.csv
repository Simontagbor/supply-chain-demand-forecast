extremely rude ground service we were nonrev flying and london was our connectionlayover gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized” however when i put it in the sizer it fit perfectly without force the plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead the gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our nonrev status the flight itself was good attendants were polite and helpful no complains there just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service i understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly i would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention
my son and i flew to geneva last sunday for a skiing holiday in les arc the flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later that then got delayed by a further three hours they didnt load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight problems happen its a complex operation what is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem the offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off the web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs at this time please try again later there is no access to people that are willing to help empowered to help or actually move a situation forwards in any way weve been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases the outdated luggage tracking system had the suitacase in geneva  days ago where it sat with noone willing to step up and get it delivered what an incredibly heartless and incompetent company 
for the price paid bought during a sale it was a decent experience although the club class business class seats offer no more legroom than economy class using shorthaul fleet on a  hour flight fast track through security was not honoured the lounge at istanbul airport was overcrowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage causing a long queue for entry  which was badly organised boarding was smooth cabin crew were friendly but their service was hitandmiss eg some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half however drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good with a choice of three mains from the menu
flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail winds the flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at heathrow so for  and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks nothing at all available to even buy to eat worse than a lowcost carrier experience in this sense one of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passengers head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin i would choose another airline on this route in the future as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin
very poor business class product ba is not even close to the other airline leaders which ever way they sell the seat on a  it is a  layout the cabin feels and is very cramped the food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish however the price of course is at premier levels the only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic i felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product would i fly ba business again only if their were no other options and i had no choice
this review is for lhrsydlhr ba and ba business class had a  configuration on  giving space privacy and easy aisle access seat reclines into comfortable flat bed good quality pillow and duvet privacy with sliding door good storage space around the seat and charging point flights on time  no delays gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation warm processed meat between two bland slices of gf bread apparently is a business class breakfast on two sectors the main course no choice offered was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil  in business class condensation had formed as the dish was reheated probably from chilled so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid one crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal do ba also serve the same gf offering in economy economy plus and first on a long haul flight my advice if gf  take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of ba for  hours my travelling companion had very good regular meals or so they told me with a choice of main course on the same flights crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered
absolutely pathetic business class product ba is not even remotely competitive with other international airlines in the business class market with old outdated  across seating  no i did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access the crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the  center seats ba like most other europeanbased airlines does not have a factual intraeuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class intraeurope flights feature the same  seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost bas transatlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow  across seating the biggest surprise on both the lislhr  lhriah flights was that ba has in fact substantially improved their food quality shocking unfortunately it is served in the worst business class configurations of any international airline i have flown the entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering  decades ago the flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a ba crew ba will simply never match the quality of carriers like singapore emirates qatar etihad eva ana japan air new zealand qantas or many others ba can compete with usbased airlines like delta american  united which are also not even in the same universe in terms of a highquality business class product one of the biggest slaps in the face is that ba expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class several hundred us dollars for transatlantic flights only if you wait until  hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost certainly another ba management decision that was made without a functioning brain
overall not bad staff look tired and overworked trying their best weird seats i was in g going and d going home the buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff i had to get help on both flights to get them to work there is another button also very stiff to bring the “leg rest” out this is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs but just obstructs your feet really again i had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons at one point the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while i tried to recline sit up or put the “leg rest” back we gave up and called the flight attendant who also had trouble ba please give this some maintenance food only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in premium ec it was pasta and was not too bad a christmas turkey dinner was offered but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available  minutes into the meal service “breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube it was disgusting same offered on return journey a cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer the tea and coffee was hot at least overall i would say air canada provides a much superior premium ec service than ba i won’t choose ba again
this was our first flight with british airways in over  years and as usual i couldn’t fault them as we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff  staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful cabin crew on the flight were great  very welcoming and friendly our meals were delicious  no shortage of drinks being offered the seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline we arrived into stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to stockholm bags checked in at jfk were delivered safely within  mins of arriving
i recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with british airways specifically regarding their customer service after my initial flight leg was canceled i was rebooked with a connection at london heathrow reduced to a mere  hour and  minutes realizing the impracticality of this i promptly contacted british airways within  minutes to request a more reasonable layover of  hours shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures i received no assistance to add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that i was presented with multiple options during our conversation moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and i was informed that customer service is outsourced to india allegedly contributing to the subpar service this experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid british airways in the future the lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet i strongly advise others to steer clear of british airways and their appalling customer service
beware ba dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason my father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and ba refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason we sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it they said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money they said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets the most ridiculous thing ive heard
check in was chaotic and badly organised even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy that meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join whilst i was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge this is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so i think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed on board the club europe seats are fine by european business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing as is normal ba do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality ba really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so i had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad i wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and i can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals i’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage ba you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out whilst i hadn’t planned on using it the on board wifi was not functioning so was not available to use overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient i used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me
all  of our flights were fine in terms of comfort punctuality and service i feel safe with ba and that is my main reason for booking with them even though i could travel with other airlines more directly on our return flight atllhr we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at lhr sadly we were seriously disappointed to serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable does ba actually pay experts to design these breakfasts low point on an otherwise good trip
ci had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be i flew business class from lhr to pdx on the ba nonstop it was a – series aircraft the flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new the business class seats were abysmal my seat was at the window facing backwards with the divider down which had to be in that position for boarding taxi takeoff and landing i was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward we both couldn’t help but stare at one another it couldn’t be avoided it was horrible the service wasn’t all that good either the flight attendant did a predinner drink when she came back to ask for my choice for dinner she said none of my selection were left i was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me she then came back later and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection i wanted i’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with i was not offered any wine or other drink with with dinner the meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray overall this flight was not very good i flew over on american and back on ba and paid  roundtrip i’d fly american again my preferred carrier is united or lufthansa i’ll never fly ba again
i was going to fly to frankfurt from glasgow over london but the flight from london to frankfurt was cancelled this meant i had to stay overnight in london where i have no accommodation etc as i was rebooked to a flight from london city airport which was more than h by train i had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £ in total london prices i was reassured over the phone that i would get all the money back my flight from london city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to london heathrow but two days later i then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with lufthansa as i urgently had to get to work and needed the money i never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight  compensation for cancelled flight  the extra food i had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight i was first transferred € by british airways they stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonba flights were going i lost over £ in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either it just really feels like they dont care about people worst serviceairline ever
much better experience this time around flew cpt to lhr on a new a checkin was efficient i used the bidvest lounge at cpt as it is better than bas lounge boarding was speedy the new business class club suites are very good slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat a instead of k which meant that after settling in the passenger in a showed up we arranged a seat switch second time in a row it has happened why cant ba staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right captains announcement was short and on point welcome drink was served at the correct temperature ie cold first time ever for me  previously ba has always served the welcome champagne warm ife system was good  everything worked as it should felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi i did not bother cocktail was good the nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff  other airlines bring out something classier a female flight attendant came to take my order and i asked for rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast she repeated back to me so you want a p and a c it was such a bizarre thing to say that i misheard i thought she said so you want beef and sea confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying p for panacotta and c for chicken but how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish like every other restaurant  airline does in the world the internal coding of food ordering is exactly that  internal she even looked irritated at me that i did not understand her jargon first time the food when it came was excellent much much better than recent flights i read somewhere that ba changed caterer if so it shows the panacotta was superb as was the chicken  good restaurant quality the wine was ok to good but definitely not good to excellent i feel that while the food has got better in ba business class the wines have got worse certainly compared to air france which i have also flown recently the wine was brought out on time not afer i finished eating as it was lass time i flew ba business cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time i had a good nights sleep plenty of snacks out if you wanted them and they did not run out breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot previously it has been lukewarm so all in all a vastly improved service offering the staff seemed rushed off their feet  it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition it would be  but i deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes
once again a terrible business class experience with ba the flight was delayed by  hours the plane was very old with problems with at least  of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure food was terrible as always with ba and only one choice available from advertised menu as a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day  which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional  hour delay whilst at heathrow at no point were we advised about our compensation rights despite asking at check in and connections or provided any vouchers during the delays having flown etihad qatar and virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between ba and its rivals 
ba as are showing their age hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts  hours cabin crew were good and helpful dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim on board entertainment was not the latest and seat back usb points didnt work the only upside of ba is that it is only  of  airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this if youre prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there
credit to ba  flew to singapore recently and also back from doha to london and both experiences were great service was fantastic as was the quality of the food entertainment and was left feeling ba have got it together after a few previous below average experiences you definitely notice the difference with the staff on ba  far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews nice one ba for  great flights
the check in area for premium classes at gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when i arrived so i was able to drop my bag very quickly premium security at gatwick is fine the flight was delayed due to nats issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this the lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable there was an excellent range of food and drinks all the drinks you would expect food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy it was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first as has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba europe business is pretty poor but in line with other european carriers sadly that being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good the on board catering was of excellent quality i was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky i do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat whilst i fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was the cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience i had the ground service at gran canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing  of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £ i cannot complain at all
the flight took off a little late due to heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient a small snack was served for free with a bottle of water additional items were available for purchase the cabin and toilets were very clean overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way
ba is great in the air but they sell you connections thru london heathrow terminal  their private baonly terminal which you are practically not able to make  minutes stopover time european flight inbound transatlantic flight outbound you arrive at the terminal gate on time and book security endless line slow process your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the x ray and then it is a train ride withing the same terminal but different distant buildings almost impossible to make lots of stress
i had broken my leg  days before our return flight from lisbon to london i called to get some assistance from british airways hoping for wheelchair assistance an easier seat to get to or possibly an upgrade so that i could stretch out my broken leg which was in a cast this airline failed on all fronts quoted us a price of € each i was traveling with my husband which we could not do almost didnt let me on the plane trying to interpret my medical report they did not attempt to change our seats which were near the back the single concession they made was to allow me to board st but did not offer a wheelchair so i had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all  rows before my seat as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches might i add i am nearly  had to exit same way no wheelchair waiting for me at heathrow had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight on another airline for me and we were last to board that flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class for a reasonable price and took great care of me
check in at mia straightforward ba use american flagship lounge near gate d which is excellent flight delayed but only by  hours boarding chaotic on board staff were fine seat was fine too but product ageing post take off service prompt slept for  hours i noticed that in club world ba have ditched rose champagne which is a shame pre arrival breakfast was ok slow to deplane luggage off ok
never i saw such a terrible customer experience the plane landed already  minutes late despite any operational delays the boarding took over  hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages after this long  hour boarding process the captain did not apologise  this is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight forcing passengers to lose train connections to home
having not flown with ba for a few years i read some of the reviews in preparation needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok we left lhr a few minutes early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule cabin crew although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta on board entertainment has never been bas strong point and sadly that hasnt changed unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad from my experience as some reviews suggest
dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british airways buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster on july  and   i had the displeasure of flying with british airways on ba and ba and let me tell you it was a nightmare the initial flight from zurich zrh to london lhr on ba faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at lhr this of course resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo hnd via beijing with air china oh but the fun didnt stop there — flight ca was also delayed turning my hour delay into a grand total of  hours finally arriving in tokyo at  instead of the promised  and the cherry on top my four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center i finally got my lost luggage back on july  because why make it easy right but wait theres more my return flight from tokyo to zurich ba on august  also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british airways the cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided tokyo tour as if that werent enough i had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements the lack of assistance at lhr airport was the icing on this bitter cake installing the ba app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating british airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look frustrated and fed up bert
quick bag drop at first wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal direct entry to concorde room outside security south ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow on board cabin crew excellent good choice of beverages and these were of high quality food was good seat comfortable no first bedding provided on time arrival into miami baggage took  hour to arrive
hours before takeoff we received a mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time so did the capacity of the heathrow airport really hit british airways by surprise h before departure anyhow  we took the one hour delay so what  but then we have been forced to check in our hand luggage i travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage overall h later at home than planed with really no reason just due to incompetent people service level far worse then ryanair and triple the price really never again thanks for nothing
i recently had a delay on british airways from bru to lhr that was due to staff shortages they announced that there was a  hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early we had to wait the full  hours inside the airplane the plane was old dirty had no power at the seats the staff provided a small bag of pretzels and ml of water to the passengers for  hour delay and  hour flight there were no options to purchase food or drink there were no entertainment options available i am a oneworld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status first class lounges at heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped the help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status the avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket british has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than ryanair or easyjet
boarded on time but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion flight was smooth and quick snack and drinks were good for a short flight landed only about ten minutes late one bag of three left in london forms quickly filled in and the bag was delivered the next morning
days before the flight we were advised by ba that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook there were flights  hour before and  hour after our original flight but they made us take one  hours earlier our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag when we arrive at heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay  pounds each to take them we explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one they would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight so we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund  months and  emails later we have still not seen a penny every time i ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting i get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake they had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me  pounds in  months
we traveled to lisbon for our dream vacation a cruise to portugal and spain our friends did not ever get their luggage it was a two week cruise two weeks without a change of clothes or her cpap machine contacting customer service was a nightmare we never talked to a real person very little effort was put into getting them their bags in one port we were on the ship and the bags were at the airport the airlines did not deliver the bags nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go get them the airline couldn’t be bothered to take the bags from the airport to the ship ba says it is their policy to get you your bags within  hours that is a joke it’s been over two weeks and they still don’t have them they are back home in the us and last they heard the bags were in lisbon if your have a choice do not fly british airways customer service is non existent
booked a flight from bucharest to manchester with a h ’ layover at heathrow flight was delayed from bucharest because of atc strike arrived at heathrow  minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage it’s a common problem with ba at heathrow i missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me i had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day there was just a shameful £ food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at lhr no accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport i asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry but they will not compensate anything  i can’t imagine a worst airline than ba regarding customer care it is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customers it is the last time in my lifetime that i will be flying this joke of an airline
booked online months ago and the only hitch was replacement aircraft meaning chosen seats were different i was informed of this prior to departure so could amend bag drop at man t wasnt smooth but i suspect that was man fault shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at lhr t the flight to cpt was full but we left more or less on time the cabin was clean and pe was what we expected sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks only complaint is the seats actually recline too far staff were very good during the first few hours of service especially george food was quite tasty but one option wasnt loaded breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time the fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into likely at cpt all in all a pleasant surprise
the flight was on time the crew were polite it was the same story on my outward flight i find that ba in europe is generally pretty good though i regret that they have substituted prosecco for champagne on the list of drinks you can buy in economy so many complaints about ba and other airlines revolve around lost luggage that i never check in bags even for long trips
angry disappointed and unsatisfied my route was from london to atlanta my suitcase was not boarded therefore not landed with me for both comfort and safety reason a bag always fly with its passenger and that did not happen claims and few phone calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably certainly i was left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snacks neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology meanwhile i was also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next  hours which also did not happen british airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization when it comes to customer service is poor and uncertain still waiting for my bag
as an infrequent flyer british airways was always my first choice with some reassurance and comfort of service quality luggage allowance etc in fact i’ve never flown with the budget airlines my most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am i actually getting for my money and is ba what they once were while the flights were around an hour delayed both ways the cabin and ground staff service were ok it is the facilities or lack of that i am most disappointed by the flight was approx  and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake in fact on my return journey i wasn’t even offered the water to top it off ba no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away there wasn’t even the obligatory flight journey the wifi was poor i couldn’t even access the shop however for a fee so much more was available this explains bas record profit of £bn so the question is what am i paying for i will now for sure opt for the budget airlines they are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for which i can decide to choose or not as ba now stands for basic airways i’ll go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper
a totally unremarkable flight on time as comfortable as european configuration goes no catering due to the storm  effect greatly exaggerated this was advised by email and a euro  was provided  not easy to use  but lounge made up for this loss
ground crew in heathrow left  passengers luggage we had  bags  the heathrow ground crew left  of ours behind after the st two were received the next day  the heathrow ground crew lost our rd bag  times and we were on the phone with them for over  hrs over the course of the week  due to this we had to spend  on health and beauty items for my wife on our cruise  british airways said they might reimburse after  months  we had to spend  in cab fare to barcelona because the bacelona ground crew iberia claimed they had delivered it to us  heathrow ground crew made us  minutes late arriving back into heathrow after our cruise we actually landed  minutes early but those incompetent people still were not ready for us  the heathrow ground crew caused us to leave  minutes late even though all passengers were boarded and ready  minutes before the departure time this will probably mean we will miss our connection in anchorage ba clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground baseshameful ba is a joke and should be embarrassed they cant operate like a normal airline they do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people
london heathrow to gibraltar on th october  i shall start by reference to the booking process i used the ba website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect the flight was due to depart from terminal  but the passengers were bussed for a good  minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand when boarding the flight the cabincrew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight the captain made  brief announcements during the flight there was no inflight entertainment the seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight the lack of catering was overt other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too the passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault moreover the usb charge points did not work either given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service the system ba have in place is not good enough the flight arrived ontime the disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen the crew were wearing the new ba uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline to be candid there was any difference between this ba service and that of socalled “budget” rivals on this route ba have a monopoly and so i did not have an option to use the services of a different company
first time flying british airways and i would not hesitate to fly economy with them again flight attendants were pleasant and efficient excellent special meal low sodium comfortable space in economy one of my better flights
i flew london to cairo and return in october  it was basically a perfectly good pair of flights in economy with pleasant and professional cabin crew especially on the return journey being only  m tall i have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane the seat was ok if getting a little numbing after  hours and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome however it must be said that the value for money was poor with a checked bag on the return leg only this was a nearly £ ticket and although i am content to pass the time by reading or sleeping it was surprising to find no inflight entertainment on hour flights however overall i would still recommend ba and would do so even more enthusiastically if it was more sensibly priced
absolutely the worst experience ever  flew into heathrow no problem waited for  hours three extra hours for our connection to porto then the cancelled the flight scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day they routed us through madrid the next morning that flight was  hours late so we missed our connection to porto because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flights after two hours on the phone with customer service from the madrid airport they booked us a new return flight then they made is pay   to fly from madrid to porto then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again after hours and hours and hours with customer service we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight meanwhile they lost my wifes luggage we finally got  days after they lost it return flight more problems with our reservations at no point was british airways helpful they left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn they completely ruined a three week vacation and they dont care they wouldnt even let us speak to a supervisor or manager awful bordering on passenger abuse
flew back from malta after scattering our sons ashes at his favourite spots when we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset a member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her her name is tracey an exceptional crew member i noticed she spoke to other travellers in a courteous manner and was friendly each time she passed my wife she asked how she was and would she like anything this kindness made a difficult time easier for us both aircraft seats were comfortable and service good for a hrs mins flight thank you ba
cabin luggage had to go to cargo even when i said i carried medicines there was no time to get them out the hand luggage the economy seats with virgin atlantic klm and even ryanair have more space luckily it was a short flight
i have been using ba for a while now and on average i cannot say that i am pretty satisfied ba somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time second the inflight service is usually weak food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests the screens in the as should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as as especially in longer flights the entertainment system becomes more important there is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket i would expect more from ba if you are flying from the us to anywhere except the uk i would recommend considering other airlines but if you are flying tofrom uk directly then ba could be one of your choices
i flew from istanbul to london in business class for more than half of the flight a child was watching an ipad very loud with no phones plugged in  it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as i could hear it above my headphones staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class has this airline turned into a zoo are staff given no training in customer service why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers when i told the staff she just laughed at me ba customer service is a disgrace ive not even mentioned the food but it was bad really bad
i have flow on ba several times since the airline started nonstop service between austin tx and london heathrow every year the service gets worse i brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section ½ inches ba has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft thankfully im not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable when ba first started flying out of austin the food was great now when i arrive at heathrow i get real food and take it on the plane with me i dont know where or who makes bas food but it is not eatable if ba did not have a direct flight from my hometown to london i would fly with a different airline when we checked into heathrow the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in it took nearly an hour to get to the counter i understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but i think ba has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits
the flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane the plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at heathrow onboard service was ok but minimal   ba gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago more concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent the airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it
i hate british airways we get to london on oct  and our next flight is cancelled we stand in line with  other people to get it fixed and they tell everyone to leave the airport and call them to fix they book us the next dayvia online dont offer vouchers for hotel we will miss our tour now trying to get home from istanbul plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago no explanations may miss next flight will never travel with them again was this same problem april  flight
our ba flight from porto to london heathrow t was operated by finnair using a finnair plane and crew this had been advised by ba shortly after booking with the option to change flights if we preferred although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to ba club europe ie with the middle seat kept free my wife and i felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better service was good on board and the meal was very tasty we chose the beef cheeks all was good until we landed at heathrow although we passed through passport control without delay once we were at the designated baggage reclaim we just waited and waited after an hour and ten minutes i went to the ba baggage counter to ask what was going on they seemed unaware of an issue but said they would find out over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost ½ hours before the bags finally arrived frustrating to say the least i subsequently complained to ba but after  weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services ‘we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes’ this response says a lot
the customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous they just don’t care long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway if the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares the onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect this time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for and yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food it’s confusing which makes it not dependable cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  the usb power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my avios points before i totally abandon them i fail to see how it is deemed a  star airline
i am a frequent flyer with ba and have been for the last  years having noted the ratings given frankly i cannot understand how ba scores three stars for most aspects of its service in a nutshell ba has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation this fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in club europe quite alarmingly ba appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its business class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency i was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen shorthaul business club europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits while cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as qatar turkish or emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality ba has consistently eroded the value of their executive club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really i want to support ba and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name budget airways the attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between british airways and another airline used in this trip both flights were around  hours in duration on the same day guess which one is shows bas inflight offering
flew with ba to punta cana took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights on boarding at gatwick realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason the crew said there was nothing they could do although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats we were told to claim a refund on return home we did this via a complaint form ns ba offered us £ in vouchers we didnt accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back we eventually got it but not without a fight very second rate shoddy airline
they downgraded me from business to premium economy they took three months to get back to me and offered me  pounds or  aud the difference between business class and premium economy which i never fly is  aud and the difference between economy and business is  aud they owe me at least  pounds and to be very fair  pounds the downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as i had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which i have pointed out to them  i need to lie down the wait for them to get around to me has been numbing the insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation the people i have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people the actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  and helpful the systems under which ba operates are some sort of medieval torture
the already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small ba logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet the interior cabin was reminiscent of a ba cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious the crew were not ba but from an unknown charter company service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row  i requested a cup of tea which never appeared thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels the over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in club europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse cattle class was definitely that to say i was happy to land and disembark was an understatement never again ba never again
caught up in the gatwick cancellation fiasco at some point between what was smooth check in unable to do online as part of group travel and security the flight was cancelled we were denied entry to security and departures as a result it was at this point that we discovered ba gatwick are not ba but a masquerade who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the real ba provide information and even though our baggage was now airside didnt have a clue as to how we could get it back it is however with thanks to a supervisor from business class check in who came to our assistance and help with our predicament baggage retrieval information on what to claim and how and our revised ba flight from lhr the following evening difficult to give a rating for cabin service as we didnt even board the aircraft
ba has a real problem with boarding its flights those who get on first fill the luggage bins with  bags one of which is supposed to be small and under seat only cabin staff dont bother implementing their own rules subsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle bumping into each other searching for space boarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsense the incoming flight was late already so our  minute flight was  minutes late
our connecting flight from london to glasgow was canceled and we were forced to wait  hours in the airport for a new flight when we received our luggage at glasgow we discovered that our luggage was soaking wet my wife’s luggage contents were wet and had to be air dried
the worst airline i have ever flown with allocated the very back row next to the toilets and galley no chance of getting any sleep question asked of possible seat movement ignored and getting bumped the entire time by cabin crew walking or pushing kart up and down aisle without one apology would have been better sitting in the luggage compartment
excellent service levels proactive crew and superb food and beverages i found all aspects of the service to be superior to ba business class even the new ba club suites first class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class the seat with sliding double doors was spacious well designed and very comfortable  british airways offered a solid first class service from concorde lounge to boarding which was actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding a consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right i would not hesitate to book first class with british airways again
booked a very special holiday for me and my partner september arrived and we were on our way to lovely south of france booked business class for us both to start the holiday right as we were checking i was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldnt print onto the ticket for some reason we had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy my girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm she didnt have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight we were held at the gate with another  or  couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing british airways over booking the flight they ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area when we eventually arrived in france late we was waiting for our luggage to come our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in heathrow we then had to wait  days for them to eventually come into france by this point our holiday was ruined british airways was absolutely shocking we couldnt speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use we felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port  hours each way to collect our cases we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back how wrong i was british airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance british airways only pay for basic essentials pants and toothpaste i filed a complaint when i got back and requested my money back for business class and they havent even had the decency to even respond they are an absolute joke of a company and i wish they would remove british out of there name because there is nothing british about them do not give them your money they cant even look after their staff let alone customers oh and dont bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back
just returned from chicago flew out  days ago on american airlines absolutely superb in every way had high expectations on return flight with ba what a disappointment the airbus a may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful very uncomfortable seats the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best our short flight from heathrow to manchester was much improved very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early in future we will travel with one of the american carriers 
ba standards continue to decline every time i fly with them this time a  min late departure which seems the norm for ba and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff the club lounge was overcrowded dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope how many more cutbacks is ba going to apply before they become truly low cost as a  year veteran user of ba while people complained of alex cruz cutting costs the past  years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest ceo one reads the occasional article about ba improving things but i have yet to see anything substantive there seem to be few british staff left amongst the cabin crew so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper lowcost  and sadly the staff service has declined year on year onboard the catering remains poor and surprised that doco can produce such rubbish meals when i have sampled their turkish airlines equivalent in august that was superb  guessing ba are too tight with their budget onboard wifi service is a joke and should be avoided
awful business class check in queue just as long as for economy probably because half of the desks were not staffed and terminal  is chaotic business lounge overfull couldnt get seats delayed flight unmanaged chaos at the gate no drink on boarding first drink served an hour after takeoff the meal was poor used to get better in economy on other airlines british airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes not looking forward to the flight home
not a reliable airline you cannot trust the timing at all i had a am flight boarding was on time but then we are sitting in the plane for already  hours and the expected departure is still not clear they have discovered the engine is not working i am risking to be late for a business meeting in geneva how come they bring a not working plane to the gate the funny thing is that i had another business trip in spring  also with ba to amsterdam when i arrived to the airport that time  i was told i dont have a seat i was put on the next flight in several hours which should have get me to the business meeting late but still not too much a lot of stress in the end on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for  hours and i have missed the meeting i thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time but today i see its routine for ba not to fly on time
i take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see im not the only traveller to put in words how absolutely abysmal british airways are the only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points we booked club europe months ago london to athens sat in row  and told they had run out of food options only choice was lentil pie or green curry returning athens to london club europe couldnt check in online as promised so arrived at the airport hrs early to be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being bumped to economy this airline fails to deliver time and time again it is a national disgrace and i implore everyone to choose an alternative 
the worst journey in my life the connection time at lhr was only  hour but the flight from mxp was on delay i had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack after that the plane just stayed there for another  minutes despite that upon arrival at sjc my baggage was lost i filled the form and gave to the employee i was not given any receipt so i did not have any reference number ba phone number at sjc simply never answer i called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address i had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website they delivered the baggage three days later i claimed for compensation online as i had to buy clothes and other stuff and i did never get a receipt i was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to mxp but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter ba lounge at sjc bad customer service the only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if i knew  i would never flown by ba never again
the airplanes and the lounges are worn out old and broken from dallas to heathrow multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed the first class seating from heathrow to dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket very disappointed
one of the worst experiences on the worst airline the flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues the time slipped from  to  to  and finally cancelled there was zero information given despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the ba lounge two hours before the flight when it was finally cancelled the ba staff without explanation told everyone to go to a gate after another hour or so they made us re enter the uk via passport control a further  minute wait by now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from ba a passing gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags ba completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of caa rules refused to find us accommodation many slept in a bus stop overnight there were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet ba had closed down and left the following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a   hr flight overall the service was shockingly bad the worst i have experienced from any airline i will not ever use them again
cancelled our flight lastminute then moved us onto a flight  days later operated by japan airlines we had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as i am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane because it was operated by a different airline but booked by ba neither ba nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available after  hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport i did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online i got a £ meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a  hour flight never again will i fly ba i would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again
i had a flight from miami florida to dublin ireland via londons heathrow airport the outbound flight from miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in heathrow the total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had  minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to dublin when we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed this was twenty minutes prior to departure time they ushered us to customer service to be rebooked given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed we then waited  hours for our luggage and then took a cab to londons city airport the cab fare was roughly  when i filed a claim with british airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare this is after i explained that it was british airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the  minute timeframe to make the connecting flight the person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate  minutes prior to departure i will never fly this awful airline again given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment
we started our day with ba in prague the flight actually left on time i came to find out that’s very unusual we purchased business class seats as you can see from the picture they hardly were business class all they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class horrible flight in addition i had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when i excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served then we got to heathrow and the real fun began we had a  hour delay they gave us about  different excuses for the delay i had a few employees walk away while i was asking them questions they were very rude at one point there were no employees left and from the announcements it seems virtually every ba flight was delayed and there were no weather issues there was no place to comfortably store items in business class i’ve never experienced that before not even a cup holder for my bottle of water the seat controls didn’t work well you had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything the power outlet didn’t work there was no internet the entire flight the overhead luggage bin was too heavy i almost got a hernia having to close it this is a horrible airline i’ll never fly with them again if i could give zero stars i would
i fly british airways weekly not because i want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer the flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues i’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate i’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but british airways are really the worst of the worst it’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff my advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect ba to get you to your destination in time
everything was ok until our connecting flight in london just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem after engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us in fact everyone refused to help us it was saturday almost pm and they just wanted to go home anyone with a connecting flight couldnt rebook on the application because the app wouldnt disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in london and the staff saw this but still refused to help us they gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app finally i got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day now its pm and i have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that so i had  choices either sleep in the airport or pay over gbp for a room i dont have the money to pay for this but after a  hour flight  hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from british airways would help us i took the room of course i claimed reimbursement but that was over  weeks ago and i havent heard anything since so i have no idea when or how much ill be reimbursed even though im not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference its financially difficult for me right now because the money i had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course its impossible to reach them by phone i feel still as i did on august   completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information
my initial flight was cancelled  hours prior the flight then i was automatically rescheduled for next day next day the flight was delayed leaving hamburg and missed my connecting flight to las vegas me and several other passengers spent the night in london british airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told us that we can walk there if we want to as a result i lost two nights hotel reservations that i made in las vegas i opened a claim and provided all receipts to british airways to get refund of my hotel reservations but over  weeks now not a single feedback from british airways i will avoid all flights with them in future and will share this story
we will never fly british airways again our flight on july   from lhr to lax was cancelled  hours before departure without any explanation since  weeks we are now waiting for the refund and ba does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellation very disappointing
check in and security clearance very quick at lhr t my wife and i used the galleries north lounge and at am it was easy to get a seat good buffet breakfast options flight boarded on time and flight departed on time i was seated in  a the club europe seats on the a seem to be getting smaller and legroom i am ft was very tight cabin crew service was fine i chose the full english breakfast it was ok but there was a lot of water in the bottom of the bowl flight landed on time overall an ok flight but club europe doesn’t feel very premium these days
british airways has confirmed itself as the worst airline in the uk last minute cancellation no explanation refusal to book with another airline “because we don’t have an arrangement with them” what’s happened to what used to be our national airline
worst ba experience i was supposed to fly out to italy on  september  i arrived at or tambo international airport ready to check my bags in i already checkedin online the previous evening so i had my boarding pass ready at the counter i was told that i had been offloaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled no information was sent regarding this beforehand the team at the checkin counter tried to get me on another flight that evening but there were no flights available they did manage to get me another flight the following evening with lufthansa to italy via frankfurt however i did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than i was supposed to upon moving the flights i did ask the ba staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order which they assured me is correct i have to fly back to south africa on  september and upon checking my booking information i noticed on my ba account that my first flight milan to london is just missing from my booking my connecting from london to johannesburg is still there after spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances the moment i proceed to give my booking reference number my call gets dropped currently it seems like i will be arriving at the airport again on monday without a flight
my daughter and i were denied boarding on our business class flight from madrid to heathrow in march   the first leg on our return flight to victoria canada no reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the british airways counter in madrid who said they were only agents and told us to call british airways we were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports after many tries we finally reached british airways by phone but we were told to call expedia which had booked the flights expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight with no explanation as to why expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights over the next  hours we had numerous calls with both expedia and british airways incredibly the next available flights were  days later on april  this was almost unbelievable but after many many tries it was the best we could do even though these were business class tickets part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight this nine day delay was a major problem for us i had to miss work and my daughter was missing school further we received no compensation from british airways no penalty fee and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days after our return i began the british airways online complaint process and submitted all supporting documents i received an email reply and a case reference number and then nothing i sent numerous follow up emails and received no replies it is now months later and still i have not heard from british airways this is shocking and definitely the worst airline service i have received for my thousands of flights over many decades i am a very patient person and this is the first time i have commented on this type of forum i think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at british airways
despite boarding being the usual free for all at lhr with groups  being called to board all at once whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate getting to board before anyone else however the service on board was impeccable superb crew friendly attentive interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job like ba in the old days and at its best food choice and quality seems to have improved too no beef cheeks thankfully and even the club kitchen appears to have returned old style club seating but is at least better and feels less cramped on the s
flight cancelled no crew th september  not peak holiday period so why such bad management by ba sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and then flight cancelled as were other on that day why does ba continue to provide such poor service  a national disgrace
the worst service ever my baggage did not arrive on time both my flights were delayed i will never fly them again  even the food was bad and your service
flights we booked this holiday were delayed about  hours no wifi available on  of  flights food and drinks very basic and expensive cannot recommend
british airways has a total lack of respect for its customers i was booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation when i was already at the airport the worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers the ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not ba employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact ba directly via phone if we wanted help they couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  so ba abandoned its passengers they did tell us that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day although other airlines were still operating the route but ba refused to rebook us on them the reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” no assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight  hours later which wasn’t acceptable as i had to get back to london that night i rang ba’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness  of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point there was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and i had a solid phone signal and wifi as i was still standing in terminal  of frankfurt main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details they just don’t care in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which was km away  waiting there for  hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted at least that flight operated on time and got me back to london ba is worse than a low cost carrier now
london heathrow to keflavik iceland in business class on an a british airways provides an unusual business class experience for intraeurope flights the seating is similar to most airlines  middle seat vacant and little extra space  but on british airways the business class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft this makes it less than a premium experience at every step from boarding to onboard the wifi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds but when it worked it was surprisingly fast service on this flight was very good and we got to keflavik on time
mumbai to london heathrow in business class on an ageing b this aircraft featured the older club world flatbed seats they are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger ones ive seen on airplanes bas new club suites are said to be far superior competing with the best bclass rivals the entire business class cabin had just  washrooms but it wasnt an issue on this flight since the premier section wasnt at full capacity there was wifi on board fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth the food was alright and no more the biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of bombay at  pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from india the airport experience is far more pleasant at this time in summary british airways provides a good but not spectacular business class product
care and support shocking written by a previously loyal ba traveller lies and misleading unprofessional service told that my flight was cancelled booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy called to ask why told technical fault with my original flight my suspicion was another reason at airport check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place how can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer
flying a business class should be a pleasure but ba has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable how could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised the tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position there is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  the window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of the whole business class set up is a sick joke eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off are there any redeeming features  the answer is no if you like a little comfort avoid ba like the plague
british airways absolutely does not care my reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful after enquiring at lax check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that no water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it i used to like travelling british airways  years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier i guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service my last trip to london was with delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that british air has now become
my recent experience with british airways was not just horrendous it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part i arrived at jfk ready for my flight to malaga only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice after a draining hour altercation i was finally placed on a different flight the nightmare continued when i landed in malaga sans luggage containing essentials for my sons wedding thirty agonizing hours later the bags showed up—but my brandnew ipad and a special watch for my nephew were missing the items werent merely valuable they had emotional significance which made the loss even more gutwrenching youd think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors  despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous their response was in essence its your fault for trusting us with your belongings this isnt just poor customer service its a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility british airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to if you have any respect for your time belongings and emotional wellbeing avoid british airways at all costs they not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence
this is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to italy our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us  and  days our departure dates june    flight ba  chicago to london june  rebooked by ba on ba  london to rome all flights were late on arrival in rome my wife was forced to walk to the checkin desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by ba she was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport also our checked baggage  failed to make the ba rebooked flight from london to rome ba took  days to deliver my bag and  days to deliver my wifes i called ba baggage claim services daily i was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour we had apple air tags in both bags and sent pictures showing their exact location to ba baggage claim several times after  days ba stated that they found my wifes bag but needed to verify ownership both bags as described had bright pink ” easily visible tags and bright pink bows taking  and  days to deliver them is inexcusable our return date july   ba  rome to london ba  london to chicago all flights were late we arrived in chicago more than  hours late missing our ground transportation to our home in michigan  hours away we had to find a hotel and stay overnight near chicago on july  we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries also for food purchased at heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in chicago after  weeks i went online asking for some followup on both cases but have had no response at all from ba we are retirees on fixed income and cannot fund ba’s errors i can honestly say that the times i was able to reach a human being they were all courteous and attempted to help but appeared at a loss 
i flew london to malaga on  august in club europe we stood around at gate b in terminal  for over an hour with staff giving very different reasons for the delay late inbound aircraft etc  but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour after boarding the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served this is club europe and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight no effort to apologise we smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a club europe meal tray cabin crew also had warmed pastries  and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley while customers received zilch ba sent an email the following morning to say sorry  nothing else what a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things i paid a full business class fare did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient avoid ba if you have any other option nowadays they are the worst in europe
i arrived at the airport about  hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in go through security etc all that went without any issues being that i was relatively early at the gate i was one of the first passengers there after some time boarding had opened first the business class got called up then families with children and disabled people a couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people one by one by name then there was an announcement they won’t let anyone in anymore me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in the reason they said was that the plane was short staffed later i discovered speaking to a manager that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked after the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore nothing changed and everyone was sent away i had a connecting flight later that day that i was going to miss because i was not let on the plane first i tried to get my luggage back which i didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel then just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane i wanted to talk to someone from british airways since they don’t have a service center at frankfurt airport everyone went to the checkin counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded all the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund i waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation after the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the checkin counter to get a confirmation from them that i will receive a refund being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened when they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault i could not attend the flight it looked like i had missed it for everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same but the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it we are supposed to get an email at some point in the future i was not able to get a written confirmation that i will get refunded even after several times asking for it i already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way in the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which i would not know if i ever got it backed
filthy plane cabin staff ok appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint paid extra for club europebusiness class food was poor they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service will be cancelling our other bookings we have with ba even if that means we lose our deposit
chaos at terminal  with ba cancellations and delays and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask  out  answers were lies sadly ba airport standards at t are worse than ever and we are long past being able to use covid as an excuse as a short haul club europe trip i expect very little from ba any more and they barely even provide that with cutbacks during covid that are now permanent if you can find an alternative carrier on the same route choose them rather than ba sadly on my route ba have a monopoly 
ba cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next  days i had to spend £k in expenses to get us back with another airline  months later i am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my  written complaints even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this so even they cannot escalate or inquire utterly useless

when on our way to heathrow airport and merely  and a half hours before the scheduled departure we received an sms stating that our flight to johannesburg had been canceled an no reason given we were then put on the same flight one day later with no other choice offered as we were already at the airport we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby and what we could do about it the business class checkin desk assistant was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following day we found someone else who told us we could check them in  hrs prior to departure so we waited at the airport an further  hours and checked them in after which we went back home we were not offered a refund nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred train change fees for the connecting flight to zimbabwe loss of one night stay at a very expensive safari lodge etc we were not offered anything snooty unprofessional uncaring disorganised lack of service avoid british airways and find better and cheaper options
nice flight good crew very good seat food was what you would expect the aircraft had the new style business class seatssuite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word there were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked seat was also long enough to really lay out and get some sleep the video system worked great and had plenty of content the headphones however were cheap and didnt feel or work particular good the layout on this  had a lot of business class seats a lot we sat in the forward cabin enter aircraft turn left and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft the crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had one draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didnt open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling together lhr is what it is crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights
months have passed and still wasting my time with the ba team sharing the same documents again and again our flight from delhi to london got delayed in december  so we missed the connecting flight from london heathrow to vancouver ba put us on a flight after  hours on reaching vancouver we were told our baggage was lost such a horrible experience and their customer relations person did not even look into the details already shared in december january april and july 
in june my flight was cancelled within three hours of departure was given a rebooking the next day and they lost my suitcase it arrived three days later today  th august   it happened again offer of rebooking in two days when trying to post a claim the website doesnt work never again ba
ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service when it comes to catering club class has been reduced to what economy was on flight ba the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges my slice of camembert was dried why bother serving it my bread roll white olive bread was dry i wonder whether anyone in ba monitors that club class has become economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in club class  now it’s a glorified soulless bus trip without britishness
my family flew from washington to london on a british airways a we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee our flight was unfortunately delayed by  hrs from  to  causing us to miss a connection from gatwick to turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport onboard i sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff in flight entertainment system didn’t work very well the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use it could use updating the food for dinner was decent they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards the seat was pretty comfortable and the flight was smooth after we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for  hrs waiting for escorts they rebooked us on a flight from heathrow to milan the next day gave us free bus tickets to heathrow gave us a free hotel room and gave us dinner and breakfast vouchers great customer service
easy check in a t galleries south and north lounges packed only just able to get a seat didn’t stay long as b gates lounge much quieter flight boarded smoothly and on time a upper deck old club world seating which is beginning to age a little however like the large toilets on this aircraft type cabin crew were all fantastic one family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success food and drink options were all very good entertainment was good overall an enjoyable flight
flight delayed by an hour it happens no biggie had us change our gate at the airport never happened before but i guess its ok gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that he did it anyway second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for  travel bud 
the staff are very rude and not trained properly no exceptions are made for children and elderly people the price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor
good domestic flight operated by ba cityflyer ground service at checkin edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful the flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled a complimentary drink and snack albeit tiny were served generally it seems that the quality of the cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline british airways flights
failed at all basic travel fundamentals  our flight was delayed  staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance the fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored  staff were quite unpleasant
they lost my baggage in a very simple situation its been three weeks and they dont care no communication whatsoever i was at the connection checkpoint at heathrow hrs before my connecting flight the last leg of my trip an agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full and then they lose it i claim it at the arrival airport immediately now its been three weeks no communication whatsoever the online status is still “searching for your bag” with no updates my conclusion is that the ba males no effort to find my missing bag and they dont care 
late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours late a single ba staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart there had been no previous announcement of the delay once on board the captain blamed frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot
as usual the flight is delayed ba try to blame someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sell why dont you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand 
i had the most fantastic ba flight today the cabin crew in my seat zone d were of the best i have experienced although the  had the old style rearfront seating  it was comfortable and felt open and spacious ba have done great things with the menu  it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the prearrival meal into hkg at pm local time having left london at  the night before the dinner offering was equally ample and delicious the inflight entertainment had a great collection of tv and current films and the inflight map was first rate previously not a huge ba fan  but after this  hour flight i could only recommend it without reserve i flew the new ba suite in j class on a recent delhi to london flight and enjoyed that product although i felt it slightly more cramped  but i think ba have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way couldnt recommend ba more on this flight today
couldn’t book in online arrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to overselling no ba staff available very helpful gatwick staff got us a bus to lhr and a flight to toulouse had knock in effect on our car booking and sharing as the rest of family had been able yo board original flight airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice
london heathrow to mumbai in a boeing  in business class the lounge near terminal  gate b at heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings it provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost  hours the  on our flight featured the older club world seating not the best in class but comfortable enough i hear that the new club suites configuration is far superior british airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect all in all a very comfortable flight one minor irritant for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with wifi we got into mumbai at  am a civilized time to arrive
keflavík iceland to london heathrow on an a in business class the journey got off on an unpleasant note  the business class line at keflavík was so long that it looked like an economy class checkin it took over  mins to get through there was no lounge access offered the boarding process was well handled british airways business class seats for the club europe product are terrible  exactly the same as economy with the middle seat left vacant you dont even get extra pitch what made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight wifi also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient midmorning time of  am
terrible experience with british airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may   my flight was scheduled to leave at  pm in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousins place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldnt find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after  pm so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation thats when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements of course they dont explain that on their website  they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending  euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga ie different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldnt travel by train to my cousins place any longer  bags in tow and i didnt want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another £ in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me  free avios  a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldnt budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they werent the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money ive been an executive club member for years and they simply didnt care they said there was nothing they could do im sure if one of the ba executives friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again
an airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is british airways i am not joking we are a family of  all in business class heading for a norwegian and arctic cruise and they lost  of our bags they will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
checkin desk rude and dismissive flight late but seems the new norm one world emerald club world checkin staff uncommunicative did not know what baggage allowance entitled to once raised politely became argumentative and accusatory
i chose british airways especially because i was going to travel with my niece and nephew and wanted everything to work well what a disaster first it took me two hours to do the checkin online due to a technical problem i also had to spend more than  minutes in a call to a uk number from my spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends then at the airport when there was the boarding time we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on they just told us to wait finally we could access the plane after  minutes inside they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled we had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours then do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off which was again delayed we spent almost  hours at the airport no information was provided no solutions were offered we had to seat in the last raw when i had paid to seat on the first half of the plane no money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given i also had prepurchased food and they couldn’t provide the service all in all terrible never again
i booked premium economy from inv to lax via lhr they notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for then they cancelled a flight on my journey to lax they then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on  the flight that i have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into lhr they rerouted me from lax to jfk to lhr  which i would have accepted  but they booked the journey in economy lax to jfk which my husband  with a knee injury  cannot do and now they wont change it  even though they have a direct flight from lax to lhr with premium economy and unacceptable flight allows us  mins to transfer flights at jfk  and my husband wont be able to walk slowly let alone quickly after enduring the hour flight from lax to lhr i have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and i also have online chat which proves i did not accept this rerouted flight to jfk but they wont budge
a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from london city airport to frankfurt when we purchased the tickets i mistakenly entered my name twice eg mr john smith and ms john smith little did we know that our  simple mistake would cost us over  pounds upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name apparently they can only change  letters where there has been a typo and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight  the price almost seven times  higher than my original ticket zero empathy was shown zero alternative was offered trusting bas staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted bas commercial change booking team and informed them of our situation the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so i told this person several times i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer i would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket he said no i could claim the difference fair enough  we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference two days later british airways customer response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight theyve continued to send generic emails until this week when they just stopped responding so in short british airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund it keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily
flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork after this was resolved the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour which is longer than the flight takes  of course ams is not bas home base and it uses contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way it’ll be eurostar for me next time
fast and friendly check in total contrast to gatwick the contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine food best avoided on board great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the chocolate and orange pot that seems to appear on every flight  have they bought up the global stock the crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm the crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled  from experience they rarely are is dry ice so expensive that ba cant afford it
i dont understand why british airways is classified as a  star airline the service is really mediocre the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience this really is all about getting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience the inflight entertainment is fairly good but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold personality less experience 
im sure that ba have gradually made their economy experience ba euroflyer out of gatwick so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class long wait at the biz checkin  due to status  and dealt with by a bored agent  ok third party but still representing ba  who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful on board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the free water which on gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle a fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on easyjet who do two service runs etc
customer service does not exist one world emerald frequent long haul flyer including ba  never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no” official bacom site said all morning and afternoon that flight from gatwick delayed  hours delayed leaving for airport only for ba to change back to original time called ba customer service  hours prior from highway saying situation  told not to worry would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport got to airport  mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for ba so could not help back on phone  hours in total to be told could be rebooked then couldn’t be round and round ultimately told to file complaint then found out flight left  hours delayed paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told  days wait for complaints to be responded to  heavens help economy and nonstatus flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets
another really great pair of flights on time no problems at all champagne was ok and my meal choices were great the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat in flight entertainment could have been better can’t wait to fly with ba again and enjoy another great experience
our a developed a fault taxiing to the runway  we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about  hours later due to a technical fault all the while ba staff were virtually nonexistent it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled ba provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own no arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport  finally managed to get the legal minimum £ compensation out of ba for the  hour delay they caused to my journey and expenses were reimbursed too but even this took four weeks the fact that as a business class customer ba pays the minimum they can get away with says it all  they couldnt care less about customers have no interest in loyalty and arent bothered about your business given its our flights that pay bas way id suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers not recommended 
horrible airline does not care about their customers used to be decent but has now since really fell off a flight time of  hours and  mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back didnt even offer juices i would stick with another airline
my family and i have flown mostly on british airways for the last  years i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset was done for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity  there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic they gave us a menu asked what we’d like did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else they then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of  we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly possibly  times a year each for us the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounges when we use them
this has been by far the worst service i have had on a plane its very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british airways they care very little about you we had to wait an hour for them to even open the checkin once they did they had  lines and only one that serviced economy even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments once we arrived at the gate there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldnt leave the boarding area i will never fly this airline again 
in nov  i booked and paid for a return journey to new zealand on my return journey my final flight was from london to edinburgh on trying to check in i was told my ticket ‘did not exist’ i showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket my only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £ since nov  ie  months ago i have communicated multiple times with ba in an attempt to have my money returned they have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £ i finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £ i have asked for an explanation but have received none only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct i do not intend to let this matter go a company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund ps they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it i tracked it down myself a week later to edinburgh airport and picked it up myself
ba is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect you pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane this is shortchanging passengers 
hours before our departure on ba to cape town from heathrow on thursday th june we did an online checkin seats had already been allocated for my wife and i   e and f  which are the middle two seats of the central block of four these were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late s and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle but there were no other seats available we got to heathrow about  hours before departure and tried to change seats at checkin to no avail although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost she did offer us an upgrade to premium economy but at gbp each it was beyond our affordability she said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed we spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic the economy seats are so tiny that i was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger with knees touching the seat pocket in front for  hours we suffered when we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me ba economy is absolutely awful the evening meal was nearinedible  both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying especially for an older person the breakfast spanish omelette was however not bad at all the previous day we had flown economy from malta to heathrow on malta airlines and that  hour trip was a pleasure the seats are wide and there is ample legroom if they can do it then why not british airways
we arrived at heathrow at  to find our flight to ibiza was cancelled by ba with no explanation as if that wasn’t galling enough the customer service from ba at the airport was nonexistent there was no explanation no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight we’ve managed to find another flight from stansted but that isn’t until much later today thus wasting a chunk of our short trip i simply don’t understand why ba don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation and work with them to resolve the problem shocking customer service
original flight was cancelled with no explanation there was no representative to help in rebooking we had to call customer service long distance call the line kept dropping had to do   calls to find new booking only to discover the only way i could fly the next day was by paying business class no help with hotel for the night stay
airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency flight was delayed with no communication given boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible there is next to no recline however i was thankful that there was no recline if the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this a aircraft no amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small no ife no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time
flight fine inline with competitors pleasant crew only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at heathrow it seems like this is standard for the berlin flights would use again
came from glasgow to london and took connecting flight american airlines from london to north carolina its my third day here in north carolina and still waiting for my luggage they didnt even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight luggage are still in glasgow 
my flight on on  may  got delayed an hour and  minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on  may  as the arrival of the first flight was only  before the departure of the second connecting flight we contacted the ba call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the th of may to kef airport through different flights the team tried to find a solution but none made sense not even on the next day the th of may  we have made full booking of accommodation car rental activities etc for the vacation in iceland the cancellation of of these booking is not refundable the call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight british airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all even though we paid additional  on new bookings and additional charges the refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week i was promised to get refund on the first call but later i found out it was not processed properly everytime i call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment after multiple calls i was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level i had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded the whole experience was terrible
cairo is a  hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment not even a magazine  which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for you have to pay for your seat choice checked in baggage food  drink wifi not that i have anything against that  im used to that on budget airlines  but this is for a premium price ticket i would have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket would have been less and the extras would have been half the price the ba app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra and dont get me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairolondon route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers and for the flyers who dont want the hassle of charges minimal cabin service and budget seats then they could easily provide a premium economy option  and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal  compounds the poor experience especially for arrivals it is also poorly served by transport links  especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many years  and was even a ba gold card holder at one point  so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice  do i fly budget or do i fly more comfortably for more now its a case of flying budget or flying budget for double the price with ba 
after travelling london to madrid with british airways then with iberia from madrid to lima and latam to cuzco my luggage arrived  days after me when attempting to collect my luggage mine was the only one not to arrive i sought help and was informed to make a claim online when my bag finally arrived  days later the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched someone emptied my st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about i felt violated i have been treated appallingly from start to finish for a month i have been back and forth to british airways yet they stated it is not their fault 
my luggage was mistagged in dallas on my way to cairo via london my luggage arrived at lhr as planned on saturday  however upon arrival due to the luggage being mistagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage it was never sent to cairo its sitting in terminal  in lhr i have an air tag on my luggage and british airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it i have filed  claims made  phone calls have been hung up on x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at ba refuse to solve the problem 
the airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip they gave me no updates their website sucks and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone they finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the us  days after i told them to ship it back to the us now i’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me they appease me on the phone tell me they’re fixing it but nothing changes the hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up several times when i called i got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later” 
we booked on the ba website round trip flights from seattle to amman with a stop in london in business class our first flight was delayed and then diverted to nyc and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency when we landed in nyc we were taken to a hospital and i stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer the same evening we flew back home confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport for the next several weeks we spoke many times with ba customer service trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service we discovered we had been marked as “noshows” for our flight to amman and that our return flight was still active we were unable to cancel the return on the website despite booking on the website our phone calls were never returned we spent a minimum of  minutes on hold for every phone call we made our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service i filed a complaint with the faa in response to my complaint i received an email from ba customer service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules they would issue flight credits  except for the portion for which we noshowed they did not state how many credits we never once asked for a full refund  we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund we will not use the credits  we were fully refunded by our travel insurance
first time flying with ba business class never again there are no boarding drinks provided my meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine on arrival at bodrum my bags were among the last to appear not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight 
you can buy sandwiches and crisps but dont expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body  there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food didnt recognise the flight number and the onboard  wifi didnt work 
this is a twoforone review covering economy and business class on the ba flight from london city to ibiza economy was excellent a very light lunch small cheeseandpastrami sandwich chocolate brownie followed by a pretty much freeflowing drinks trolley the flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job this is a flight i would recommend except dont fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £ in each direction as i did i flew economy out and business back while my brother flew business then economy the business seats are identical to economy with no seats blocked so you are squished in four abreast the meals are almost identical with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £ the only real plus is champagne but on my flight there was none because of supply issues the cabin attendant i think his name was tom must be one of the best in the business i didnt eat so i paid £ for nothing oh well so great flight but stick with economy
absolutely horrible airline communication is terrible last minute delays cancellations seat changes with no communication app and website user experience is years behind other airlines seats are cramped and uncomfortable overpriced would not fly again
having experienced delays and cancellations departing from usa to europe and now a  hour estimated delay at lhr heading back to usa i would warn travelers that ba has become unreliable and is now on my “do not fly” list until they get better organized 
travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey  days later world traveller aka economy class both flights departed on time return flight landed early  but  we then had a   hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok  fas particularly on return flight pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful  no legroom at all no better in club class either  only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall
this flight failed at every level we were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another  minutes for us but this was a ba holiday we pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound british airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in heathrow as there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on wednesday evening having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday i might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available i would like to make it clear that we are british airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically
beware of british airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest they wont treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes we recently had a trip home planned from mrs to sea a mechanical issue meant that we departed late from mrs to lhr where we needed to make a connecting flight we landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate but a series of issues and choices by british airways kept us from boarding our next plane the crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere  minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines plus we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed we were pushed to virgin atlantic to figure out how to get us home it extended our travel day by  hours we were traveling with children as well no offers of compensation or upgrades were made and now ba is refusing to provide us any financial compensation we paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections multiple airlines to deal with security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on that is not what we paid for but ba refuses to make it right so beware potential travelers
i flew from cairo to heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat horrible service i get to heathrow airport  minutes late so i had to run around looking for my connecting flight finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate given a seat that is different than what i paid extra for  it’s a shame for such well known airline
i flew with numerous airlines but i gotta admit british airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support i waited  weeks for a ticket change call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up they told me i was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes but never got they dont have a live chat just like american airlines do they dont have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number total garbage
we were traveling as a family  people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only  hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to checkin the lady at the checkin checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldn’t figure out what was wrong we only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a  year old and a  year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there
flight at am from dub to lcy cancelled pm night before no text message no phone waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option hang on what’s this it was dark at am it was hard to see mobile phone screen i’m still jet lagged only option was to lhr at am tried calling no one there so accepted it but i didn’t see the day change it was the next day i didn’t want the flight as was staying at docklands hence choosing lcy but thought i better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight nope i better call to say hey sorry i screwed up your flight is not going to work for me i don’t have any more accommodation in dublin and i don’t want to waste one night in london called the most surly customer service can you even be called that when you treat people like this answered she kept calling me james not my name she was brutal you accepted it i can’t do anything she basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion i accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer she kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen but if you had called us we could have put you onto a aer lingus flight why didn’t you call you are at fault just so callous and uncaring she wanted to charge me  pounds in new flights and change fees i said nope and booked a flight today with ryanair plus i need to find my way from gatwick to docklands more money from me because of ba’s utter contempt for their passengers i’ve been flying qantas for  years and they can do some funky stuff but never this level of cruelty because of one simple error never again how do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude welcome to the uk just wow
terrible i have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights the customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as i no longer intend to use ba for any further flights terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff 
the customer service is ugly tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight all i get is someone in india i thought i was flying iberia once i looked close at ticket it was british airways will never fly british airway ever again
most uncomfortable flight i have ever experienced its a long time since i have flown longhaul the cramped conditions were awful the rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my tv was so close i couldnt focus on it  ba seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade this has not worked on me i will avoid flying ba in future my onward flight was with latam same  aircraft but more room between rows far more comfortable on the return flight from santiago the lights were turned down at pm i feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service they just disappear behind the curtains
i booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to monaco i gave us over  hours for our connecting flight to and from home through heathrow our flight left seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight we were rescheduled before we even landed they booked us on a flight  hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue no earlier flights were available when we arrived in nice france the airport was closed including the rental car desk we were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night we found a cab which cost us  euros one one to get to our hotel we thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home…we were wrong our flight from nice to heathrow was  minutes late with a  hour layover you would think we should still make our flight unfortunately long security lines caused over  hr further delay when arriving ba closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving mins before departure after running through the heathrow airport and going through security again they sent us back to the customer service queue where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow after begging they found us a flight on another airline at that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with delta we were given  pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional  hour delay in total for our trip there and home we spent  hours at heathrow airport which our original total layover of  hours and we were offered  pound each unfortunately the drama continues the two bags that they said made the delta flight shockingly did not we were told that we had the file the claim with delta since the last part of our flight was with them we have now been home for  days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other as i said to both of them today i don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage i dont want your  reimbursement per bag as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that i have in there i will never fly british airways again and delta’s baggage people are not doing great either
my husband and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba on  february and return on  march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on one occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curryspicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british airways
may  flew from seattle to heathrow then to edinburgh ba lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes club rentals tees balls i had tee times at two courses in st andrews that took months to make the promised my bag returned in  hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses i contacted ba and they state they would only reimburse toiletries then the return flight home was randomly canceled by ba without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight i contacted the corporate travel team they informed me ba canceled my return reservation they rebooked me on the same flight ba customer service was horrendous and make false promises i will never use this airlines again beware of british airways they also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members
i went through three flights to reach my destination all of my ba flights without exception were delayed both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent whats not understandable is that they werent prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so i ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after  hours of traveling i had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since ba didnt communicate properly with them i gave ba a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that i had the last flight with which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints i contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didnt address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me  for the kind personnel thats holding this airline together though
an excellent flight in club world on british airways the welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight the crew were attentive friendly and very professional on board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines in flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio the seatflat bed was very comfortable  british airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the a i liked the sleek minimalist design this flight showed that ba can be among the world’s best airlines
the flight schedule was delayed for one hour after boarding the plane we were delayed at least another  minutes when we arrived in london we were delayed again for at least another  minutes to find a gate we were left with  minutes only to catch our connecting flight to barcelona we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight when we arrived at barcelona airport we discovered that our check in luggage was still in london very painful trip disrupted our vacation not flying with ba anymore if i can find alternative airlines 
the worst experience in all my years of travel my first flight with my two kids from boston to london was delayed by  hours resulting in me missing my connecting flight despite having a layover of approximately  hours i ended up waiting until  pm to board my flight to cairo unfortunately even that flight was delayed i would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline even if it means paying a bit more for a different option
the worst experience in all my years of travel bag was destroyed flight delayed  hours and couldnt get water on board then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldnt work you cant contact them plane was filthy and someone elses belongings and left over food was still in our seat
terrible delays had to rebook our domestic travel for  passengers and haven’t received any reimbursement on the same lost all my luggage received luggage after  days had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding no customer service rep picks up the phone
a serious medical problem appeared while i was onboard i informed the crew and they helped me out unfortunately i was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell i became also i could not find my way back home in my condition thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until i returned back home it was a stressful experience but the crew of british airways made it way more tolerable
i havent flown british airways before and will never fly them again the checkin process was terrible and slow there were over  people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it they had one agent working the first class line it should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service we had to run to the gate and we did make it but they were terrible
my itinerary was supposed to be las vegaschicagolondonvenice when i landed in london heathrow i was stuck on the aircraft for  hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay i missed my connecting flight to venice getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place our flight had over  people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight they put us into two lines one of them being for people who missed their flight i waited approximately  minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me since i missed my flight i would have to go to the connecting flight ba service desks for further assistance if i were to have known that was the only information i would receive i would have skipped being in that line altogether when i went to the service desk where there were more than  people standing in line i waited  minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the ba site since their systems were down and couldnt rebook anyone it was a hassle doing anything through he ba site so i ended up calling the helpline after waiting to be connected to a ba rep i spoke with a woman who said i would have to call iberia airlines for a rebook i called iberia and they said since i booked through expedia i would have to call them expedia then said i would have to call ba for the rebook so when i called ba again the rep said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following monday mind you i was travelling since the th which was a friday all the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked i was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went i still dont have it most of the customer service i got from ba reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me they acted like i was inconveniencing them with my issues i also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked overall my experience with british airlines has been the worst airline experience ive ever had to deal with i will never book with this company again i would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again
busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good
worst seats i have ever encountered in economy class no leg room at all i had to spread my legs to fit staff at the terminal rude “business class” offers the same seat but with more legroom and they block the middle seat they cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane where there is more legroom just so the “business class” passenger has an empty seat between them plane is old with no onboard entertainment for a  hours flight last time i will fly british airways
top ten reasons to not use british airways to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly don’t waste your time or money customer service is nonexistent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note #  the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret # – when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership # what airlines operates  days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways that’s who #  they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text # if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notifications #  if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesn’t matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid #  the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seats # they will route to another partner airline and not notify you # – if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice then my job is done
easy check in on the way to heathrow the flight was on time with no issues our return flight to valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at heathrow this was with another airline and was not a connecting flight i asked at the british airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at heathrow we had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes that is indeed customer service thank you
online check in worked fine quick security check once onboard quick flight up to glasgow water and snack provided all in all very pleased cheap quick and efficient
the ba first lounge at terminal  was a  zoo at pm dirty tables and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started  mins late the flight was operated by a finnair a which is barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seats poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty  i remain shocked that ba allow this and its time for bas ceo and management focused on standards rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down budget airline type service as the whole trip turned out to be  and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips i thought post covid that ba were better for a few months but with the many cost cuts they are making they fall well below all other european full service airlines 
paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over £ for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal  which was very crowded being  in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b and waited there for  mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in a and c seat b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and nonexistent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money
words fail to describe this last awful flight  baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhrsfo its understandable for a baby to cry nonstop  but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin  that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scones ive said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service ie dont do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work  this time i swear i mean it  never again on ba please the lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat  poor ba is on the skids downhill
absolutely terrible experience the app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid documents but then did not accept them even when provided i was trying to fly back to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors i went to british airways customer service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger even though i was there in plenty of time this was also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flights were limited i was delayed over  hours in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport
ba overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer it means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage makes easyjet and ryanair look like customer champions the server in itsu in the ba terminal says she stopped flying ba years ago due to the service being bad all the time most customers she serves have a complaint staff dont care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence
the flights were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight the seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just wont use them again
only the second time flying ba as first time wasn’t positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another bad show business class fare should offer more
i wasnt going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no predeparture drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great
i booked business class tickets for my fiancé and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to get have my flight refunded the representative on the phone informed me he wasnt sure how much i would get as the refund department needed to check but estimated i would lose  of my booking to fees i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received  total back less than  of my booking costs since then i have spent over  hours calling different departments before they blocked me ive lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show
i will never travel with british airways again i spent over  on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing  cabin has  seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for  hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with  seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is  i paid it but note that there were only  seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways 
i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i was  minutes late calling them even though i tried for  hours to get through the day before now i am unable to get back and they have kept the  pounds customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you
terrible avoid this airline it’s now becoming regular practice to cancel flights had a cancellation from switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices
despite being a gold member the british airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra  “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first  hours” as if that would make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals  they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans
regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times ive been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and dont provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wifi in business class is not acceptable another example of bas penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasnt much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days
i travelled with british airways from sweden to los angeles via london in december  when i arrived at lax one of my bags were missing there was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about  minutes i found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind i gave her my details of where i would be staying and she told me that they would contact me after a few days and still no contact i tried to call british airways customer service the woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days i told them that i had switched hotels and gave them the address for where i was staying and everything was fine but then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i was flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questioned him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one i came home and a couple of days later i received my bag i made a complaint and claims on british airways website since i had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because i didn’t have my bag in january they said that they would refund me for my claims it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations i don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british airways and the lack of customer service
food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us  hours just to go from t to t and clear security check the place was chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with  minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline
had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged  years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at  am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again
the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience
second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year
they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on  we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal  and sleep there finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats
at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways so many issues with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with  avios attached which is equivalent to maybe  on a  flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss
due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i can’t describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “you won’t get anything else for  hours you know” the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid £ for wifi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldn’t even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful  what i don’t understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew 
lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about  years out of date the public washrooms in t are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than  full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only  mins late breakfast had  choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldnt mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really dont care any more breakfast trays cleared  mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid £ for  hours wifi and dropped connection for the next  mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping 
i wouldnt recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for  times in different days and time and i waited for more than  minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for  weeks  website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you dont receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldnt recommend it is such a shame that in  they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for  hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal  i had to take a bus to terminal  the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to  pounds and we would be reimbursed i was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasnt their problem and that it was iberias problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but dont want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal  their people gave out false information
this is the worst airline not one thing went right i don’t understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over  minutes to arrive horrendous
i will never fly british airways again to start the plane was over  hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasn’t really business class there were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class
worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a  hour flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more
i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside  when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took  minutes i believe the heathrow t were having strike action that week
why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it can’t be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in 
after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover  of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like i did
literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated ‘sorry the flight is full’ the flight then took off  minutes late  no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude ‘whoops not sure how that happened what do you want’ genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet  at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba
i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary teacoffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i cant think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet
obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious 
lost  out of  checked bags denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba from lhr to ord on april   ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online checkin never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately i’ve lost respect for british airways disgusted
i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about  years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline
boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i don’t think £ for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick  it felt like it was am even though it was pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be
mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isnt too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to bas club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food  bar really pleasant we flew an older  with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just  rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge layout there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without secundary checks we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent barcart service i love the doubleservings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really dont understand ba stuck to it through the years noone like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a  minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it
very poor service very frustrating firstly my flight to lhr was cancelled on  mar while i got a text message to inform me the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam once this was confirmed i went to the counter to get my new boarding pass at the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in mins for the hotel we me and other fellow travelers waited for over mins there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions the transfer hotel was  mins away from the airport when we got to the hotel which is around pm the staff informed that dinner closes at  that was a rush it appeared more of a motel than an hotel the room  was smelling of weed being a nonsmoker this was uncomfortable although i wanted to compromise and rest when i went to wash my face the tap on the sink came off in my hands i panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room after some discussion they agreed to change it i went to the alternate room to my horror it was occupied i asked the staff to call a cab and i left 
generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe  minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were us no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away
ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed  passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for  minutes 
flew from london heathrow to marrakech ba changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats boarding was chaos staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold i had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with  bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels this airline is going downhill rapidly
i was meant to fly in january to algeria i paid over £ for the ticket just a few days before i was meant to fly my wife broke her foot i had to then rebook it in march and pay another £ i called british airways  weeks before my flight in march and i told them again that it had to me rebooked as my wife was still not well they told me that i don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as i sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well however they never sent me the ticket they made me wait for nearly  weeks and they asked me to pay either £ on top of the £ that i paid previously or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £ tax only i found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money i previously paid each time i call them they hang up on me or they continue telling me to pay £ i made a complaint and nothing happened
we have flown repeatedly with british airways and the one world alliance over the last few weeks every flight was delayed now we are back at the airport in miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight finally our luggage arrived in puerto rico with a day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip  we havent received any information about our luggage to this day luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there the last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they cant do anything  wir sind in den letzten wochen immer wieder mit britisch airways und dem one world zusammenschluss geflogen jeder flug war verspätet nun sitzen wir wieder in miami am flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive verspätung sodass wir unseren anschlussflug verpassen werden zuletzt ist auch unser gepäck mit  tagen verspätung in puerto rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine info über unser gepäck erhalten zum glück haben wir selbst am flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… beim letzten verpspäteten flug meinte die kabinen crew dass auch sie ihre anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen 
i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they dont even provide napkins unless you ask with the premeal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased  other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic  ml bottle of water its just a sip on the shorter flights the seats couldnt even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost  hours and we had to wait on board
the worst cabin experience ever cramped seats very low cost style and uncomfortable could suit for short flights but not for a  hours service catering is also a shame ml of water  a chocolate bar for a  hours service will never fly ba again 
first time flying with british airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbai to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine  i appreciated that they didnt come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping the meals werent that great to be honest after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for  minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage didnt make it due to the short connection time in london the ba baggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient
the latest affront stood in first class line for an hour finally go up front and the ba agent let  supposed vips with  large tobechecked bags in front of all of us arrogant and unapologetic add this to a long list of postcovid disappointments we are done with ba
booked a flight return flight between london and munich for  to  in december the return flight was cancelled and rebooked from  to  british airways only notified me of the first change but not the second getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions each time needing to find a helpful representative british airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket they tried to charge an  change fee through repeatedly calling back british airways reinstated my  flight on  and then again on  to make sure it did not get changed again i checked the status of my ticket daily from  to  it was intact those days on  when it was time to checkin for the flight it was gone at the airport the staff at the british airways checkin counter are not ba employees so cannot help resolve problems there are no ba representative at the munich airport the confirmation documentation from british airways was of no value i was left stranded at the airport
i tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible i was given no reason for this i telephoned ba customer service and must have wasted nearly  hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information staff need customer training better knowledge of their product and some manners ba customer service was virtually non existent i will never fly with them again
a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after rerouting via vancouver which added over  hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put back  hours is now delayed by another  hours avoid british airways like the plague
our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of  in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgwdbv boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour  messy illfitting uniforms and unclassy makeup toilets clean and maintained appreciate antibacterial wipes being kept available postcovid inbound dbvlgw for some reason no online or app checkin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual checkin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful proactively offered to take our larger handluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for  minutes for no reason its truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements  during the flight one couldnt even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline ones ba are installing from row  onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed  minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given  we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise wed been stranded for hours wed spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given  because in the context of the shorthaul market thats what they deserve  we fly ba as we dont fly the lowcost carriers after so many bad experiences but its by no measure good just the least bad option given  point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard
if i could give a minus rating i would supposed to be lhrams at  on th march get to lhr at  email to say flight cancelled no one able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcyams at  so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not bas fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the  departure go to desk to drop bag and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the  to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the  flight to rotterdam the  and  were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from amslhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the  is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the  departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just dont care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you really need to go
plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen but on arrival at heathrow the plane sits on the runway for  minutes as there was no free stand to go to then once at the stand we waited another  minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane just pathetically inefficient
we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it was not was premium we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times bas premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok the flight back was in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs they have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs i would rather pay more and fly with someone else
this was literally one of the worst experiences i haven’t been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for  hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags even though i booked through to dublin another  hours i was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party
the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on th february at  this happened to be our first flight with our newborn  month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under hrs before scheduled departure the original th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express i’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly  minutes to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’ if this is the service level for silver members i can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait  minutes as his computer booted up  ba then proceeded to autobook us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the autobooked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location km apart they couldn’t understand my frustration  eventually someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at  not ideal as i’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg  the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled  minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening   ba unfortunately that meant hrs in the grotty lounge with a  month old baby it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didn’t get our push chairstroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground  they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathysympathyunderstanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with
lost my case and took  weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after  weeks i had a business class flight scheduled on dec   … manchester  copenhagen bangkok and return flight dec   … bangkok  stockholm  manchester sas airlines left manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control when i arrived in copenhagen to get the connecting flight for bangkok we were  minutes too late and the flight had gone half of the plane missed it sas airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … copenhagen sas  london ba  dubai emirates  bangkok i returned from copenhagen to london and the collected my boarding pass at ba we were over  hours late leaving london due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight we arrived in dubai late and was informed the flight had gone emirates then informed me that i had to speak with thai air to get another flight issued i spent over an hour phoning thai air with nobody picking up the phone i then spoke with thai air dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that i buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later i paid £ for a kuwait airways flight out of dubai  kuwaiti  bangkok whilst in dubai i checked with kuwait airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from london and they would locate it and forward to my bangkok address the following day my baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms i arrived back home yesterday and was informed by ba that they have found my bag in london 
the incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because french air traffic controllers were on strike so we were routed over germany and not bas fault o arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance it took around  minutes to find someone then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge all told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate total disruption wasted time absolutely no excuse for this
back in december my family and i as we were getting onto the plane were refused even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked  months in advance we were refused it turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldnt let all the passengers on the plane so quite randomly not  people were selected and turned away we were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if i had connecting flights in london etc i sought compensation from ba which i was told i could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been they wouldnt acknowledge my complaint for my family until i had an authorisation letter from them saying i could act on their behalf even though i booked and paid for the tickets so i uploaded the authorisation letter no less than  times every time they told me they received it and every time i followed it up they told me they hadnt there was no other way except to post from australia to the uk to some office eventually it finally go through to them i have now chased up the reimbursement four times each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient today they tell me that they need to check my account details so again i send them the same information that i have done before and i wait patiently for my reimbursement i am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away well you know what i wont
as usual the flight is delayed this week it already  hours and i’m held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane i really can’t explain how much i detest british airways if it was a cheap budget airline i could accept it but it’s premium prices for the most unreliable service
a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time within lhr standards and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can’t
we are flying business class for most of our flight and then premium economy for the balance in addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional pp for our seats now ba is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife  i when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional  to be reseated next to each other  they moved our seats away from each other and we shouldnt have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together we havent even flown yet this airline is horrible
i am in australia and on friday night went online to book a flight from heathrow to malpensa milan i did not realise that when i specifically searched for flights to malpensa it offered options to other airports in milan when i received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in milan the itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the  hour cooling off period as it was the weekend here i was unable to reach their office until monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as i had missed the  hour cooling off period apparently as the ticket was issued in the uk i needed to contact them i have now cancelled the ticket and i will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying british airways
at  am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried  times ba provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling  hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair
would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhrist was no frills but jfklhr was impeccable good food lots of moviescds on the ife open bar service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drinksnack
flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means there’s no other benefit  one drink service on  hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables  min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this new planes have been decorated terribly  feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if it’s not too expensive  seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if you’re in the middle 
first our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable however it lost us one days experience in cairo we were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats on both flights as my husband had spasms he had to stretch his legs across my lap and not once did any of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling as the service came to us for food each choice we made we were told they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left i did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints they responded with a  pound voucher for our group
although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could  such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers
boarding was decently organised the a still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a was nearly full rather poor amenity bag the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing  minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority
boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks  nothing wrong for such a short flight fas were very friendly and landing on time
my original flight was cancelled just over  weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service
delayed just for a change poor communication british airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline customer service is impossible to contact and it seems ba tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when its available
very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row  where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board  huge line for toilets   min into a  min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed  as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar 
check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row  which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed  mins early and then waited  minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice
my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on th february  i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have  minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you” she refused to let me and about  other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat” i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting  minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong” he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a £ voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop
this was my first time flying with ba  i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but thats not really a huge issue
lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb th  our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at  and had several delays until  then we had to wait  minutes for our luggage to arrive
ba  on the  boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba
not only my first flight in  years but also my first time back to england for  years i flew from pmilgw on  and returned on  both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the € charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable  total cost for both flights was €  regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom im  tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughmans and ipa beer €  total on both flights i have flown  times in the last  years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgwlhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline ive flown with
my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by  pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our  am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didnt know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldnt do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another  number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from  am till  pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldnt wait until  am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff  a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at  am they didnt charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities
organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe
outward journey ba london to buenos aires club world  january  our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats f and j another passenger was occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related  my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus  january  was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout it’s a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above
check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor  barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections we’re very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money
very disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at pm on  was cancelled replaced by a flight at pm it took off  hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay £ for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug i’m only ’” but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and takeoff slots
excellent service both on the ground and on board  while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg
good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold
a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good nights sleep fruits etc first couldnt manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard
this flight was one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost  hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about  minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about  minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained  small glasses of juice   i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price 
it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after  minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba 
as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over  decades multiple times a year on th january  i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the th january  by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the th january  they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund it’s lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly £ the total cost of my booking was £ which comes to £ per passenger leaving my refund total at less than  of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba  policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than  refund even when i’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone probably for more money than it was worth a week ago
a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on bas part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time
easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in
being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold  he was really accommodating and it wasn’t a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at allsaying the other guy shouldn’t have let me and they will have a word with him  come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier 
i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly  when on a  hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment  i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great  what you got for your money not so much
flew atl to lhr th jan  was unlucky enough to be on board a  year old  refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinkssnacks offered  meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it  very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for  hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average
great thing about british airways a is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner  wafer thin bits of dry turkey  over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline

the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day  and ba staff over the phone say call after  hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we dont have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after  days
probably the worst business class experience ive ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional  on a single leg lhrlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba as leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a was over  minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal  at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first as were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of  there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website  and did not upload any covid documentation  i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas  beverages available to passengers during the flight  as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not   long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my   height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery
definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i’ve unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least  times within the last  months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen
ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times it’s reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i don’t know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips
i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it ife didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon
when will ba update their business class cabin   across on a  it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat  an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable checkin ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive 
paid £ day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about  minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at £ maybe £ its a long flight but their offers of £ or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been  or    with the luggage fiasco i cant rate it more than 
ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate  no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why cant the champagne  white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall    flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad whats become of ba
absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldnt get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a  hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne  instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future
vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec nd we received an email on dec th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation  hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost  from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin  hours before take off we found that our van — lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional  per person price difference and the dates offered were about  days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about  cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for  hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take  minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for  days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for 
old a with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t
another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under  called before the  people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over  we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out i’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please no you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for  people and the guy in a got it i bet he felt like he’d won the lottery ok i’ll have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains  i’ll have the curry no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with christmas dinner  i’m going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldn’t eat it so basically my husband and i have spent £ on  return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots
ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only  hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad if they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the th despite the road to keflavík being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered  not really
ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city  hours later my car was at heathrow i didnt want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost € for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could get home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the €  months on its such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey weve booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service
turned up  hours in advance terminal  at london heathrow was already carnage s of people trying to check in only  desks manned long queues at security due to only  lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by  hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha  hours wait til next one received a voucher approx £ for the whole day arrived  day later my suitcase didn’t arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for  days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i don’t know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs
boarding – at gate at lgw they called group  to board we were world traveller plus  group  then called anyone in groups  whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them cabin crew  treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service – we were in the final row of six in wt which has a total of  seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for back row seats but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the  menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given  wt meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadn’t thought of that food – some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a  biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks – they ran out of red wine  hours into an hour flight toilets – there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic  months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glassescups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future
missing baggage customer service was the worst i’ve ever experienced i arrived back in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where i received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear back within  hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon 
british airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the checkin staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service  the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost hr to board  passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the bar service was good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne onboard and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a featured wifi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to bacom and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there
stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over £ for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique pushmepullyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas
seat horribly narrow  on a  thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well
glasgow to london delayed by  hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you won’t be disappointed planning ahead there’s a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld it’s extremely risky
when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £ i decided to take it but then the website wouldnt allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the checkin agent was helpful but couldnt fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasnt too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better ive obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good
i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality  excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet meal service could not get more unprofessional   rows took two guys nearly  mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapeslike bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after  mins plates to be taken away  when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any no coordination between the crew  crew busy chatting at the galley in reality  the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for 
disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard 
during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldnt even order any food  drink because the card reader didnt function the first and last time well fly with ba
i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by  hours as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about  full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest x plane i have seen packed in like sardines my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with  different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day 
booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a way street
extremely subpar service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last  minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered
i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shoutout to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive im going to have to start spending those avios
i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights
british airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldnt let me checkin until  hours before the flight i have been trying for  hours to check in through their website andor find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i didnt think they were speaking english 
flew from amman to london on nov   not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is hm we received exactly ml of water and about  potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldnt even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it
this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august st  i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost bag i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and theyre not even getting back to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba
flying lhr t to cpt november   ba app and website not working properly  would not load my ticket lhr t smooth and calm checking process quick  but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination  ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared  someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information  b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience  flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba
worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed  hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only bag i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible
check in was a shambles at bwi just  counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular checkin queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey
beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after  weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service
on july th  i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and weve lost  days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in  weeks i will be receiving it its  months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my followups on the matter
i booked the flight on oct  but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i cant get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than  weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways
london to gibraltar on th october  i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience 
i’ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route i’m after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at  but after continuous delays finally left  hours late not ideal when you’ve then got an hr  flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board we’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at am for the  pm flight 
a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels provided…etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatar’s standards but that’s another story
i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival
just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal  experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though it’s just become an experience to be endured ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any  but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys
a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wifi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats
baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took  hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered a is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yinyang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of  seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days
evening flight from lhr to iad on an a check in at t is poor most of their kiosks dont work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left  minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a  hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention
we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the  hour check in i spent £ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for  hours on a flight with a seat that wouldnt recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid £ for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the  hour check in only to be told no they dont do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they cant refund the cost of booking the seat  emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a £ ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadnt payed for the seats prior to the  hour check in then a £ voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain
while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response 
lhrlax i prefer the boeing  over the a as the seats dont seem too cramped checkin was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine
flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite  a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off  hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fas  especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent inch touch screen refused to pay bas extortionate prepay to book your seat fees and still got  seats together cmon ba  do we not pay enough already to travel club class  i can recommend bas new club class and we will travel this way  if we can afford it  in future
i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend
london to cairo first on this  hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order
this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba
hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase
dfwlhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a left me with the feeling that this plane type wont ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was  inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasnt too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning prelanding snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but im not sold on the a t at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is
check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off  mins behind schedule with a  minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t was as long as the flight
check in at lhr t was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of  to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight  mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly
the checkin process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intraeuropean business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the  choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were  business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the  passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t such things will affect their reputation
this is my first time flying bas new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal  which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to prepandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class
my am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than h notice  without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only get me a flight  days later they did not work with me as i miss  days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice  but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is  seat available so i changed to am from gothenburg  heathrow  jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp  as i “changed my flight a nd time”  i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation i’m entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs
i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i don’t know how you manage to keep smiling couldn’t fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i can’t wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you
british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at  miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do 
good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart onj and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t work
flight was  hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps
london to istanbul british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about  are considered as business class with very short leg space  no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class checkin while waiting for flights 
london to manchester british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took  hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude
flight was cancelled at the last minute due to “weather” despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport  hours ahead t horrendous checkin and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done
after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier  congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not  rows like last time but  rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports
this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didn’t want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when so they now have my money and i have to rebook at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up
manchester to seattle via london i will never fly ba again they cancelled my return flight from heathrow back to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night i will not be flying ba again
our flight in march  from san francisco to london on th march was cancelled with  hours’ notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on followups it is the usual  min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to reschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were rebookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem  how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama
i sat in seat c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways
full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well
i was told id require a  hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my  hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a  hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled  i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience
having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at  to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and cant walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about  am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist its not their fault its the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the offer of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities its just not worth the risk of travelling with ba
i am a business class customer british airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with  stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date would not work they attempted to charge me additional  for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything  if you try to reach out no chance
barbara collins was super helpful my boyfriend  i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later one barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together  even managed to put us sitting together much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks  nibbles were great  staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba
my husband parents who are in their ’s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job
on our recommendation my son and his young family child  and baby  months and wife flew ba to the usa from cape town leaving yesterday evening just got off the call with him after their arrival at heathrow shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided or not especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for   years of business flights from rsa this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday my grandson had a coughing fit so they asked bell push  times for glass of water  all ignored last one was told wait till drinks are served then when evening meal served  no food available for the  year old which was preordered online they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been preordered  the cabin staff supervisors response  prove it sir that sealed it for us if that’s the ba response to what’s seen as cattle class  it will permeate to our normal travel class so our next booking will be an alternate
we had a nice flight pushedoff exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things friendly for the most part as well dinner hot and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferentnonhelpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a  week trip to england
holidays ruined  suitcases lost in  flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we couldnt take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam one of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was  days ago and we still dont have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they didnt allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam  suitcases  different flights theyve ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i get my property back no information lies and more lies  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the money back in  days yes i might
despite bas promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications including to the chief executive have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con  they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba
refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october  which is  months now i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to email protected several times and all they tell me is it’s been processed british airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on till today i have not received my refund i am just wondering what is happening
customer service is nonexistent for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on bacom i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly my sister and husband had tickets on the july  from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sisters ticket not once but twice it took almost  weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times  times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken hearted sister the price was  plus a  service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husband my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until  days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within  seconds was told there was a  increase british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply dont convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company
flight on a sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall
for this  hour  min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone or like me you can preorder weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again
my wife and i booked a flight in april  that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport  hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in online which we hadn’t done  we were instructed to come back in  hrs and  mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at  pm  mins before our scheduled  pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight  mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay  pounds to go through “fast track” security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggagespace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london  mns late and after going to the “flight connections” we were told  mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the checkin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the checkin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the checkin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in  hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight  days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured i’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying  more days in a hotel  just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim online this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk 
decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on th june from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly  hours we received a  cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where  employees working and a  people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only linedesks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after  hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat  at some point after  hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleepstay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent  additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims  refund process is non responsive as we already requested information  times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight 
reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley  could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldnt sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate
three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a threehour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic checkin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of checkin staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone checkin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a halffull bag of crisps offered as a snack on a threehour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate  passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor
routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a  minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine
over  week ago i cancelled  club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than  years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further  bookings with ba planned for the rest of  i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare
flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within  hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a  star rating and have them again
check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with  children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight
washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost one day one day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here
nairobi to new york via london british airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call back within  hours i call every  days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more money on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier big mistake
today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from checkin through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husbands nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were  bags checked and  on the plane  i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the  out of  was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about  hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now ive had bags not get on flights before  less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info  eg your bag was loaded onto the plane your bag is on its way to baggage claim ba doesnt seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadnt flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again
british airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no one to check in  flights departing within  minutes of each other  hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older  usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate
i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid  to reserve two seats on our own in a  configuration cabin as i didnt want to sit in a row of  people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of  the email also stated that if i wasnt happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could get a full refund of the money i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid  cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable
departure was about  minutes late the a we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft  felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds  better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport
was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didn’t even know it was cancelled someone behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all 
second time getting poor service from ba st unable to contact via phone email or website nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until  hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last  hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course noone at the airport could do anything 
booked a flight from london to paris  trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as would not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does anyone have any other options re complaints we would be most grateful really not fair to just take our money 
we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not  but  flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over  hour a total of  extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped ba cost me  overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates  don’t be fooled
the flight was delayed over  hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways
terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after  days they delivered  of our  bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already  days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i dont recommend at all
ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldnt book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april th  from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldnt find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking id get a full refund i was refunded about  of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldnt fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didnt get a full refund each phone call takes about  minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about  phone calls later thats  hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more  in total less than  of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i wasnt getting a full refund i didnt cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation were sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on  april  your claims been refused because ba was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i dont know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about  sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company
belfast to london on  jun  i was informed at about  flight ba has been delayed to  will only reach london heathrow at  i reached the airport at  but ba counter was only open at  at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at  on the same day the reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline there’s nothing we can do” i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next  hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from  i have to called another number for “urgent cases” which ever number i dial i just couldn’t get to speak to any one till  again i was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own  i would think twice to take ba in the future
the customer service of british airways is really bad you cant reach any call centre agent even after waiting for  mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing bas low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldnjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with doco for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from doco overall my rating is  for ba  you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew
ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to  only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing
this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel  dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus  helpful and friendly fa minuses  the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat  even the fa found it difficult the inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor  one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i dont know what the business class offerings from bas rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia
as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at  for a  departure  mins later  late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they dont hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last  years the food standards and choices in the t first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short h m flight was a light dinner tray only  choices by row   with  passengers in club europe only  salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given  menus for  customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while doco supply this the doco meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish  days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip 
right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait  hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within  hours and we didnt so far it will be at least  days
i could very much understand losing my luggage for  days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location the man on the phone verbatim stated “and if i don’t” after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was “not his problem” before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjetnor is this westjet’s luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before
the a is a wonderful aircraft  quieter than any other aircraft ive flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost  minutes at london terminal  for baggage to arrive  excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba  a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight  no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba
lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers pushback delayed by lack of tug club suite seats kk a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to get through immigration
covid form is broken  called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone  hour flight delay  was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have  hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba
feels like ba are putting the economy back in premium economy very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this alreadydelayed pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew could come back later if you wanted something else  including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldnt leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food ive never experienced this on other airlines premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware  brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after wed eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed underequipped understaffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable inflight entertainment was great and the screens large  unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens brightness levels reset to their retinasearing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick  were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly checkin queue at cancun took forever couldnt see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative bas problems all seem so easy to fix  their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why arent they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point
phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a  hour layover in heathrow bags didnt make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a deadend no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible checkin desk other baggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again
worst airline experience ever flew  people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had “exchanged” tickets after  hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group  but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with  children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also  hours late then they lost our luggage  days later they still dont have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a  minute to  hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them 
the crew ba on  june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew ive ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed
i travelled on the th april with my baby in economy class flight ba  and ba  i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this
outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didn’t matter the crew made the flight outstanding
recent trip to boston departing lhr t ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us  minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within  minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density  layout in economy compared to the  abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and proactively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew proactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by doco was exceptional i dont think ive eaten so much on a transatlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an outstation overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again
my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada  swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment
as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhrlhr on a miles ticket in february  when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond at the rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake
boarding on time but unfortunately from ort’s worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond ba’s control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the  was showing it’s age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight
flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than  hours rechecking our bags took  hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline
check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar and finding the flight was delayed by nearly  hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for  hour flight no leg room on isle seat of  the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice cocacola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr  man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for  persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from  to  so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again
british airways  travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in  late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline
business class seating shown as a x configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat  not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to  options by row  out of  in business class and by row  where we were seated only one of us had  options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class
we arrived  and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least  hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced 
ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within  hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative  hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will  that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesnt work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in  hours
i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in  the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldnt as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she didnt have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in  working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in  working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now
when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over  hours to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was  after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by  minutes they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was £ i originally paid £ for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for £ flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss  days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again 
another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wifi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case we caused the plane to go unbalanced really it’s all one excuse after another with ba these days
basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights  cant checkin could checkin online or via the app customer service is nonexistent busy line after min still no one there to help me check in
very low standards for club europe there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket no inflight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best
this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing  overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing  than in the old b or even than in the b seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy
british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me  more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over  hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust
on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the  come out of my account the next day as i’m adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about  hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking i’m not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again i’m extremely frustrated
amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation
i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin  more legroom upon checkin my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am  and not deaf sometimes they would purposely hang up before i said anything other times they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they would hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle 
we are on our way home after a  week holiday in the uk and have had all  flights with british airways our  internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the  long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didnt realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional £ for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent  minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal  and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal  overall it took us about  hours to get me checked in after speaking to about  different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed kg and the bag was kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect
i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight
i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had  rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit
we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the th april  check in was very fast and we cleared security in about  minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of  main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways
i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost £k extra to change our return flight for the family to get a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost  hours later there was no option to get any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure 
business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with  avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers
our good friday flight was delayed by hours std  atd  to durban south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply didnt know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service
we had a trip with  flights included all  flights were delayed the worst with hmin also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a h earlier flight loosing h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really bad experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels
my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly
i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on th april  zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal  on ba  april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british airways partner at pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had  short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied “if it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience
we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however  days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is  miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled  hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again 
the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasnt good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of  entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i wouldnt mind but on european trips in  ba are charging up to  times the fare levels of  and the overall value for money is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings

shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with  years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day
i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong  i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last  years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff  that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked as they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a  minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that  people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over  minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again
the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer  across but this layout still squeezes in  across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats  days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the  hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after takeoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this takeoff was just after  hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline 
a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience
british airways is the most terrible airline i’ve dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you can’t check in online the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return  i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again
british airways is the most terrible airline i’ve ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our   year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers
ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought id buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived  mins earlier than scheduled whats not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last  years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once
new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba
very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly
ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldnt be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of  flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations ontime including having  business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds  months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us 
flew back on ba bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites  the end of this awful yin and yang seating cant come soon enough even tried to pay bas extortionate prebooking rate for our seats  none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle  seats of   e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though bas policy has changed regarding flying back to a nonmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off  minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast  fairly dire my wifes smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good its really good but when its bad its awful i recommend hesitatingly  come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats
the worst budget airline i’ve ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over  hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet then left  of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another  mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us £s then on return i’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again i don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but i’ll be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again
first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all  flights zrhlhr gvalhr  lhrzrh first  in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrhlhr impossible to checkin online and just  staff to checkin everyone for  flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gvalhr hrs late as noone at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhrzrh mins late due to slow gate staff even when you checkin online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard  getting to be onboard 
have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wifi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than  years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be
flew to barbados  march on ba  in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fas called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the inflight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown  the usual extortionate fee charged for prebooking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming  it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats
very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the  am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa  minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some  hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below  of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case
our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after  hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again
complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at am today was over  hour and subsequent flight to malaga  hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays  times but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry  ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for  years since beaboac days
feb   we show up at the airport  hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for  hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another  hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldnt let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in  minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was  late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went  days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days its declined we have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passiveaggressive messages  they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for  days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from
british airways are in the process of upgrading all its  fleet to the new club suite but ba had the yrsold packedlikesardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical timesaving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy its hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow
we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldn’t check in online we arrive at heathrow  hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just  desks open for a queue of approx  travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful and took the best part of  hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husband’s vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though i’d previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didn’t want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy
absolutely bad experience with  british airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first one i understand  covid unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may  was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them
flew ba lhraus on a  on the outbound leg and then back on the a on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhraus route lhraus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time auslhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad   screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number  in line and waited for  hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator forms ready  verifly app ready and  or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr  the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline  i would not fly ba
the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash browns such rubbish on ba
i really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so they’re using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having  passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean it’s first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so we’re in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally i’m happy in club and would never do first again
london to dubai family of  kids where from  down to  years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought well get something usually around  hour into the flight  hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as youd expect from many other airlines even a kids book would be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience
one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may   yes the weekend of the last but one it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug  to bologna  ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb th  received a message am mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online  a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home  not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to get one of the last  seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop  soon ran out of seats by  midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments  told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron  had a consistent queue of about  people as ba were still cancellingrearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to reconcile luggage when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a fivehour flight they purport to be a topclass airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation  well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline
we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhrmle wasn’t too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience we weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in businessfirst actually i think ba only care about the businessfirst customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice  rows back in our cabin it’s not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we weren’t fed until hrs before we landed it was a hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing  slices or cucumber and  slices of tomato ba just don’t care anymore about the little people
british airways is getting worse an worse my flight was  mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive  no communication whatsoever from anyone they cant be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do
paid for  business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldn’t even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again 
absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen fooddrink order to be brought to me ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average 
our flight back to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline whats worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again
flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of hamcheese for breakfast after a  hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only  minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last
there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over  contact attempts spanning  hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised  weeks ago
the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about  passengers but business class was threequarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and takeoff on schedule sadly ba makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba there are some good points about the old club world  the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat  but other than those its an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious postcovid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but its a lacklustre experience in contrast to bas competitors and smacks of continued costcutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage
british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from  years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before even if weren’t the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they don’t any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around  years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason  this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful
outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes
british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba from london to malaga on th february and across  visible rows around me there were  out of  passengers wearing face masks  and i was one of them this was long after the meal  drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules 
for once more ba got it all wrong with  hours delay food voucher of  pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity
another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday  february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via ba’s website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a were a disgrace
check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t arrivals lounge which was excellent
very old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable
having just booked ba for a return flight  being one hour each way in club class and paying   euro for  persons to be then asked to pay a further  euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model
ba got everything right allowed evening before check in  this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in  minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options  roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done
appalling customer service  they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the telephone with no response or you just get a recorded message to say they cant take the call they dont respond to emails sent to the complaints line 
this past novemberdecember i flew washingtonlondon return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the prepandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to rebook a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my rebookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances thats to be expected its good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and im looking forward to future trips on ba
i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about  minutes before i could speak with someone and within  minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on i’ll definitely make sure to check with british airways first
ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around  capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again
boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate the club suite cabins were about  full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than  occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight
unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the bad was the inflight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wife’s didn’t and post ipad era just don’t live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff i’m afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels
utterly appalling company weve flown with them two times now and both times its been a disaster the first time return flight was delayed by over  hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we couldnt choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i didnt get a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba dont even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible 

over the past  years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a  hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february  i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had  to  staff ran a kiosk queue of over  unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for  hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a  hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november  i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with  minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now  hours and all i got from the guest services was a £ food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for  minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £ seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted  back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing 
return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from  to  and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at  with departure at   minutes late drinks service only started  minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was  however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around  i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club checkin and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew was in  and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different  the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys
i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to  hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises
i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as i’ve witnessed the airline decline into a subpar service i understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but ba’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba checkin terminal  even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights terrible efficiency at the checkin counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days
the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline
straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after  minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after  minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the selfserve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didn’t with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what you’d expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost  times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards
on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board  we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the checkin desks luggage drop and checkin was appalling it took us over  hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after  small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one checkin desk for euro traveller  club europe one for bag drop and one for the checkin  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport
in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off  i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant  i used the ba lounge in terminal  not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t to t we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another hrs  mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes its not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time ive never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss  heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined  both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is
after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats k and k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yinyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isnt dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back
i paid  for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me id be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me id be getting  back which is less than half of the  i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded  i emailed again and they told me id be getting  more back when i emailed again saying that that doesnt add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with thats the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of  and i was only getting  total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and theyve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me
very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as  passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row  has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing  i think it is great that they also have food  alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t arrivals is a breeze
overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row  it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row  in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising  klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers  their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was £ one way £ return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money
first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that
flying during covid is always a challenge ba’s verifly app worked perfectly and online checkin was seamless the bags drop at t was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older  it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after  hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed
flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on  is  seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba
i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t is a mess with  minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant  there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame
weve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better inflight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being  minutes early was rewarded with a minute wait for a gate then a  hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times
my flight yesterday  was due to take off at  soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for preboarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for  hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day
it is first time we have flown ba business class in a  aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the checkin and crew were great  friendly and helpful it was manual checkin not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and  choices for main course business class seating is  with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger  nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first  rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row  and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row  now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partners legs not some stranger i am ft  and could just about manage my wife at ft  could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible
i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost  months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per email and i still didnt get a reply it has been  months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service
british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all
i have a flight booked for january  they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover  hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i dont even get an apology just cancel
i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home id been under the impression that it was a simple process  just call up and book onto the same route that id previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves  but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines id redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and thats just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent  who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues  took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code  and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference  nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over  weeks  on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day  around  hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though ive flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has gone significantly downhill
extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp  miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as  flt was changed to a  hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british airways had rebooked with delta this took about mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated
british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the am flight from t at heathrow to paris cdg on nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about  customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk 
i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at pm for a pm departure there was no staff until  and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger
check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by  minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m not the airlines fault  replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a neo went ahead the club europe cabin was  rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at  tall i can fit ok however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop  start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not bas finest hour
arrived at the south airport in tenerife  hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with  person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a  meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a neo with  rows of club seating the seat was ok for a  hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew
checkin very slow no app checkin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row  even worse  crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba landed at  no gate so waited and waited for  minutes then ba jetty didn’t work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable
after h queuing at the checkin desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have
outbound seated in row  i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherds pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier  as if ba could not get a better one on the return boarding from the back not by priority then seated in row  i had the last half glass of champagne only because one of the other passengers in row  had declined food was rigatoni with vegetables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful  not for us again
flew club europe london  tenerife south  november and returned  november club europe seats are not comfortable  you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of  empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room  it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine  apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not prebook seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights both in a new or nearly near a both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south  just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge  the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend  there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become
hours standing in line for boarding pass airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least  minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst
i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because im flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online ive tried live chat several times and waited  hours only to be told theres no one available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line someone immediately picks up of course however they cant help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesnt deserve to be a national airline i havent had these problems at all and ive been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately its been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i dont even speak spanish 
this whole experience was sickening over  grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option
poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around  hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for  mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around  passengers including me had to wait from  am until  am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba
currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “live chat” all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldn’t change the name told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully well you’re going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello it’s the st century you should have a button saying “change name” anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said “thanks for your help i’ll deal with it la“ got cut off  minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck
another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a  load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery
flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left  minutes late but made up time en route there were  rows to the business class cabin on this a service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered it’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if i’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about
upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day  test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day  test uploading it onto our plf’s verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through checkin he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba
club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz
good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a gate at lhr t so we were bussed to the plane first time ive used a bus gate there the a was at t at a gate with a jetway nevertheless  passengers full flight boarded via steps  this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the baggage taking ages also the seat recline on ggatl f is broken
usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value
check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
what has happened to british airways the whole preflight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the ’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise it’s due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for  passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in  apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace i’ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me k of spending to earn so that tells you how much i’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year i’ve booked  ba flights  personal and  business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries  of the  have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return  days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for  weeks that cost me my £ holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march  i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after  days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher i’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline i’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i’ve cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book  flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed who’d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option
i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much
the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in  k to begin with  i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea  there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight
the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight
i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows  to  were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline unlike the seats in rows  to  i was in row  this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba misselling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldn’t have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i don’t know how they get away with it
terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldn’t go still can’t go as borders are still closed i wasn’t given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still haven’t been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding  the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be i’ve been such a good customer and feel i deserve better 
this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines checkin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service  seating was extremely uncomfortable  inch pitch and  inch wide seats  just about bearable for an hour and a half flight  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers
lca to lhr in club europe quick checkin at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full  rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard wfi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldnt be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through egates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the postcovid standard for shorthaul business class
i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday th august  to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sisters name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emailsmessages one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day 
we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didnt receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for  minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the inflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service 
the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing
an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale  not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england
i’ve had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around  hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldn’t get us to our destination within  hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment it’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment
the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i can’t give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in  i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria  mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same  we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at  was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast
such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight saywhaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with  sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full  mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly
lhr to lca galleries lounge chockablock first thing on a wednesday morning and t seemed as bustling as prepandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back  rows  the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch postcovid lunch remains restricted  doco must be horrified by what theyre having to produce miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish ive ever tasted wifi access wasnt free for business class passengers £ for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca
very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the  male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfastbrunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbonmadridlondon who were cold and unprofessional
no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for  mins plus
no refund for flights cancelled  months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until  april  tickets bought on edreams on june   for a flight on july   from geneva to são paulo through london british airways round trip the lhrgru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last  months but they did not refund the  euros that i paid
stranded in the lounge because i wasnt allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didnt want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasnt available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options
i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really means because it doesnt pass the commonsense test i purchased a roundtrip business class ticket from new york toandfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we cant answer your call try again no ability to leave a callback number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a thirdparty agent i did not  i bought it on bacom and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having  negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new  return flight to the us ive now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was misbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctors note saying that i was sick then theyll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation 
my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was  hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an  hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience
year after year the british airways ba service on the same route washingtonlondon is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july   british airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from pm to pm so we had to spend an extra  hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check ukgov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us  per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like  times they are still giving us the run around 
ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flights get cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for  plus minutes to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel 
the entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was  years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a shorthaul flight after flying with aeroflot and s airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think it’s unacceptable for a nonlowcost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff 
i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid £ for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands
very efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early
me and my  year  months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on  august when we landed at heathrow my baby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping baby who is nearly  kg and luggage bag another  kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no one to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder i met no one whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control  i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases  no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all
for this flight from heathrow t passengers were piled into the bus and left for  mins at the terminal  very unhappy passengers  and when confronted the ba transport managers response was sorry  we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame  since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event
ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your checkin this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about  minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last  flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight
they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher 
i’ve been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not… interlude to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason with medical treatment being one i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so ba’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd  lhr flights because who knows i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money i’ve decided to avoid ba from now on
check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time
departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of  minutes for luggage
booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day  bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasnt ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within  working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they cant give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the phone 
the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a  hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a  hours layover thats before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra  hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didnt do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute 
i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned h and d called several times but they couldnt do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they didnt allow us to seat together 
i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat preselection in biz class   uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were bas universally derided cramped across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement  i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available  even though there were only  people in my  seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest ive ever seen in biz class  it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the £ that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket  but of course got whacked with bas unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of  for using miles
aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and checkin and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that checkin carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just  passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much prepackaging  the covid effect presumably arrival into t was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the egates and collecting our luggage just  minutes after landing
i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful
after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t was blissfully quiet with no queues at checkin or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnson’s bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just  pax on board  of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’ service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual doco quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience
ba cancelled flight in dec  refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now  months down the line  calls of which each is  min waiting time and  email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises
fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water it’s a start
boarding and disembarking were greatly organised passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved distribute handsanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row # business was overlooked for some reason after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food  staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba  still it left some strange experience
this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage checkin this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable  i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i dont expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived  minutes late
ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight after having my return cancelled  times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the “evoucher” and i would need to call up to rebook i’m in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled  times i wasn’t offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way
absolutely appalling experience british airways unfortunately has lowered its standards and to my dismay ive been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered  i recently had my flight cancelled on  occasions and the staff werent interested in helping me return home
had booked the above mentioned flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didn’t notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for checkin it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didnt realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions didnt allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they didnt realise i couldnt fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i dont have any travel plans for the next two years that means my money is gone when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was onetravel the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didnt allow them to take me a poor show with ba
my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled  times when i call to ba several times their computer system didn’t work and they couldn’t issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage as i couldn’t pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i done it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost baggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they wouldn’t compensate anything 
cancellations for  month applying vouchers only to find out they dont work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to anyone in covid restrictions
i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with  but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly  no lounge at all at mexico city terminal  theres a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldnt help with the details mexico city terminal  has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible  but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an  hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what youd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where id left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isnt offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to  or go to another airline the company just dont care
charge £ fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says £ fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page  of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount  i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative
good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed  understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either  just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wifi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic im sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know
i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mothers funeral with the flowers she was apologetic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight
i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldn’t get home i’ve also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding i’m not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal  she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldn’t do it as my results didn’t go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive i’ve come to her  times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady i’ve ever met unfortunately i didn’t catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i don’t know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in
dubai to london on th december flight was ok  seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross  both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming back to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything  not like the crew were busy either did  services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines
this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are openlimited hours flight on time and well presented a staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again
i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my sons bottle didnt even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny  glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i would give emirates  and british airways  its not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again
overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service  everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in  the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing  which i mean as constructive criticism though  i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for  days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received
i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munichlondon citymunich within  working days in a friendly and professional manner the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are  adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways
boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not preordered my flight was  hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry
i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didn’t let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but it’s still very good tasty lunch box from doco with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around  mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority
we had a flight to santorini from lhr at am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at am and the queue for checkin was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over  minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the checkin had closed at am and that we had missed the flight british airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini would be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth £ for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we would get nothing 
my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris  late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name records air history
i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was  or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and ml of water  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring  or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal  was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for  euros one was was available but it didnt seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean
newcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well
due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on th august  and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours
british airways canceled my flight to london on june  due to covid it is july  and they still have not refunded my money ive reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british airways service is nonexistent and they will keep your money they are keeping almost us of our money
london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date  service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better  and  weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasnt appeared in my account after  days to get back in touch  things go wrong its how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasnt a clue
ba cancelled my flight to lyon marchapril  because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and telephone service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member phone number is inaccessible as ba has reduced telephone access to one number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as in these difficult times they had to protect staff this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their money this is appalling business practice
a short hop from london to edinburgh in november   efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from
total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid  when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional  for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic 
i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for  people through the ba website paying us  in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as  we are not allowed to travel outside the us  as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and  the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airbbs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds andor vouchers i’ve tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly  just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for  as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august st to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways
i booked a trip to spain for midmarch  with american airlines british airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i would have been quarantined in europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon reentry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to spain with the travel ban enforced the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them
i booked london to tel aviv in jan  to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional £ so i would fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to get and they deducted £ as a service fee for the upgrade calls and emails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund 
i booked my honeymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september  i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my honeymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my would be wife this was more than  in additional cost the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my would be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again
this company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was get a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you don’t have voucher 
tokyo to london  hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable  it is all about money with them 
flight ba  on  february was delayed  mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived  hrs  mins late i requested compensation and was refused  for three emails they told me my flight to london was delayed  mins under the  mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived  mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i dont know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence
london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large highresolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the  and 
my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the checkin and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic  but we flew out on one of bas new as and this brought home to me that the  business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tailwinds
i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed its borders so i could no longer get this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldnt yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for  hours and still no one answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didnt want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice when i got back home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an involuntary change to get a replacement flight  that is not what the customer agent advised me id never even heard that term before he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he didnt say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they dont know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that wasnt good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything  i will never use this airline again
during the time of covid it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight i’m ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things what’s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher  you can’t use their voucher online or for a cheap flight  on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even won’t use my miles with ba
do not accept a british airways evoucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted  evouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has money and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they dont have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you cant redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to phone them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after bas approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future
londonheathrow to warsaw on th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with  groups boarding sequentially i didnt try the paid marksspencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy 
just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal  i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was  left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can 
at checkin desk at t heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website  i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eueftaeea  uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes  ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while inflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy
i booked a flight with them on  of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with someone no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus
a journey of  halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they werent honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could rebook and showed lots of flights  none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better  a total wait of  hour  minutes to make  calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba werent accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent  as usual food was good  verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for  years because the head office is so poor  the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed eg over securing clients data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes  whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba
i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over  hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online  i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else… before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about  minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldn’t do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid but never again ba
very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid effectively holding onto my money illegally do what’s right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a  hour wait on the phone very disappointed  i expect much better from you
i booked my flights to the uk in may  and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march     days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march   and because i am older and have preexisting health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were nonrefundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may  for travel to the uk by may  or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may  with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or nonrefundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may  this pandemic is over for all of us 
mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did
i have a booking for march th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on  march to state we’re working closely with the foreign  commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on  march and it states the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal
london gatwick to funchal british airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on  march for a weeks holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend  days in quarantine no matter how long their stay thats a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble
lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a bad joke to add insult to injury the  amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed would retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this oncegreat national airline is palpable 
london to new york jfk another grim flight with british airways in club class on a tired and old b the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying  yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats
diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble
frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october  the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying hrs the  hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me 
london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a  year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over  years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line
london city to berlin on th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled
london to beijing in january  ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for  hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like  calls  emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not bas partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again
mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service
london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next which given the size of the t check in hall wasnt helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude  especially when we discovered we were seated separately it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored
paris to london flight cancelled due to “atc restrictions” after storm ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by  hours arrived in london  hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked  flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgwbgylgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since  and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfranceklm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame
i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving  february on  february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of  february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldnt help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight bas complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again
gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays theres unfortunately not much difference between ba  easyjet flight left gatwick late  arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to get worse
vancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b is showing its age but it’s still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and i’ll continue to prefer it over the b 
i am flying london to seattle in business class in may  and british airways wants around £ each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasonss what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes £ off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat  without asking me what i get is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring  minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up 
london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t to cram  firstclass seats onto a  is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flagcarrier represents britain so badly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because bas business class is so poor but never again
dubai to london my husband and i traveled together he got business class my ticket was a last minute addon so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husband came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didn’t and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasn’t ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and i’ll show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow i located my husband in the business class apparently his seat had  extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it
london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba
rio de janeiro to london  economy  packed out seating awful food very narrow seats uncomfortable expensive add ons seat choice luggage try to match norwegian pricing on the rio route ife was iffy my back and legs have been terrible for  days i paid £ for an exit seat the breakfast served was unfit for me i took my own drinks and some food items long haul is getting the same as short come prepared
johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes
las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the  was the most uncomfortable flight in business class i’ve experienced  the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of  that’s a tight squeeze andthere were backward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didn’t pay full price for this flight
ba cancelled my return flight on feb from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight ive tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them 
mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasnt actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely theyre always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever
london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a cabins although unfortunately without any inseat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get inseat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient preflight experience at heathrows excellent t fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a  ft  chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints
i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july  arriving late to board my heathrow flight the checkinstaff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to get to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled 
madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in  or  to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money  dont waste your money on this  
prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about  minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the checkin partly the website’s fault as we had done the online check in we selected the amount of bags we each had it said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £ for each bag apart from those negatives and the delay i would definitely fly this airline again
johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible  feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by  hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and ive given up expecting anything more from bas business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside  minutes after landing reliability is currently bas strongest card
las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight ive paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about  cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but  of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a  hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the preorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same im used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so im used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semireclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasnt quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all s wooden panels
san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong  which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on noncore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient  going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said ‘holiday inn’ there are about  in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldn’t talk to me because i ‘failed’ security i didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a  hour layover from am to pm getting me home over  hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a  hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class who knows how they treat economy passengers
cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious winedispensing machines boarding was quick and takeoff was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was  minutes ahead of schedule
on th of december before my flights departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasnt allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful  she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i havent had any food for the whole day as i didnt have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you
phoenix to london since moving to the usa ive been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you wont be disappointed with club world
london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for  hour flight i know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy
mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you cant carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston  hrs after i had come even after contacting bas baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like  minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience 
i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british airways only gave me the seats i paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british airways to get my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of  despite several phone calls and filing multiple online calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again
toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the  was generous and seemed to be more than the official  pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on longhaul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacifics is far superior the two major downsides  the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on longhaul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickleanddimed id fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of checkin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at checkin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely  no complimentary catering on shorthaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying tofrom heathrow are connecting tofrom longhaul flights with ba and have spent at least  on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the shorthaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on lowcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines
hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights i’ve had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best i’ve experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight
san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing  cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row  d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row  k j with their bags and blankets i would not recommend ba or the 
singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a  hour flight  hour stopover and  hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around  hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than  hours after arrival meaning  out of  days in paris will be spent without luggage
warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft its important to choose a seat no further than row  in aneo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in bas executive club you can pay for the food  drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag checkin at warsaw airport   opened checkin counters for approx  people is rather not enough
new york  to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline
london to los angeles take off was delayed by  hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection  sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids    sitting on bulkhead with  seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section  not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back  days later conclusion never fly ba again
british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back  rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comair’s idiosyncratic ‘fourcourse meal’ ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese  biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule
london to bangkok its not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer  disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at lhr and  mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as bad my most recent experience was early january  when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the  hours long haul flight together however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep
london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by  mph gusts but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats jk are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was  minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just  minutes after landing overall a good flight
overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing  to a boeing  which is known as the queen of the skies  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing  and boeing if they still plan to use them on longer flights
los angeles to london on th january and my husbands seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience
gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was bad and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how
fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airway’s club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around  hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed ontime and landed  minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the inflight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been eversoslightly more leg room and inflight entertainment i’d have given this flight  a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline
rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a  class business world traveller plus and economy class  cabins in business class front  rows and rear  rows i had seat a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at  a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side jk i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about  minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed
gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me  the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well  the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight wfi service for  pounds you get unlimited very high speed wifi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts
keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after  hours on the ground waiting for the diicing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them nonalcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the deicing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for takeoff how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we cant fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done
fly economy and you’ll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible 
my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was  hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tvs stopped working mid flight also for a period of  minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as  year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service
london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wifes remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasnt allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wifes when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a jobs worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer
los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service i’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets  months in advance to ensure that our family flew  hour flight together the flight to london didn’t have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class i’ve flown the checkin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them
istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up  hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for  minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving ms food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic 
london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through  i was seated on row  and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from one row to the other h before take off cost me an additional  gbp 
london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at ab but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food preordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didnt really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight
london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they dont provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly
copenhagen to london super slow had to wait for buses which were delayed also packed the buses to tight with people where too far from arrival terminals service bad from staff coming to terminal  is the worst terminal on heathrow the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff
budapest to billund return via london on  and  dec  a aircrafts checkin in budapest had a narrow timeslot of  hours before departure with long queues i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer hold a gold card with qatar airways at checkin and had to struggle to get  bags accepted as inscribed luggage i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr there is no oneworld  lounge in budapest so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways for ba i do not have status in london granted access to any oneworld lounge onboard food and drinks with hefty price tags  water is not free flights were full but on time i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive luggage delivered perfectly return trips  legs were both full flights but departed slightly early granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t in london loads of good hot foods and good beers and wines onboard there is no ife no seat recline mediocre not cheap but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding
i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights
sydney to toulouse via singapore  london boeing  and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tlslhr sector a £ celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a gt hit the spot you could argue it should be free but i’m not complaining  i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines you’re still pretty good
sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient
my husband and i had a wonderful flight to barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble josey and her team were made the the journey amazing having flown with virgin for many years i can say it’s night and day tank you your staff are amazing we will be british airways in the future many thanks
london to munich ba on  december delayed by  mins dated not very clean a boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggage turns out plane is half empty no complementary drinks and snacks will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economy never again
hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didnt match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan igot in contact with bas executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her
my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged  times for one bag after i was assured charges didnt go through have been trying to get a refund from ba since they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged  times for one bag only  months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing  charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didnt owe me any money they force you to communicate via email and then dont respond they owe me  usd and refuse to give me my money at this point 
new york to london i was on the last flight out at  pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing  certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick  hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier im a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two 
austin to london along with an  purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional  for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the  seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba
frankfurt to london with british airways awful airline put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together gave me middle seat even though many others were free a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you dont book biz class avoid
london to glasgow with british airways flight is again delayed it’s not like it’s a one off as it’s delayed every week like a bad joke really a poor yet very expensive airline who i wouldn’t recommend to any traveller
london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldnt be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably  ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of worlds favourite airline the  has seen better days however given theyre being removed from most airlines passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before theyre gone im gradually regaining my confidence in ba
heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the  flight to belfast on th december
london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr  but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost  hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flights service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives
toulouse to london im a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat id put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline
london heathrow to stockholm business class shorthaul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the gt and good food
johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an  hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again
johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it theres more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasnt at all bad  when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasnt too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product
london heathrow to miami flying the boeing  unfortunately ba hasnt done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my  makes the beds small and since its so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable
stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent gt and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the s economy they taste great
london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at  we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when reboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for hour min nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again  hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over ft tall
london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal  were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about bas  to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and welldeserved reputation never again
the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there werent any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea  times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am  and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didnt get any better after one hour  minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about  cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing 
brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on  nov  seats c and d it was a boeing  with a  seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy classlike the service is very friendly but not personal i’m used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class  while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put  personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running  the breakfast is good  yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience  if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight
san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit  hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight  hours  minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for  gbp 
i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin  minutes late
london to johannesburg with british airways ba’s b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal it’s also a tad closer on the transit  or via the rather useful walkway on level   to the c gates where the as depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group  moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average
london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on  november  was delayed by  hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by  hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for  mins announcement was made the flight was delayed hrs mins due to maintenance 
london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening st november they spent nearly  hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found  mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight basingapore to sydney  november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well
lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me  euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again
ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and im sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence im very disappointed with the service they provide
doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation
london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to get up and walk around during the  hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrushtoothpaste etc no such offerings
san francisco to london a is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button midflight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for  minutes i don’t see how that is acceptable
sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy
london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline
los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much
london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostesshost seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normalnewish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in  i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul
the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to ba’s incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline
london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered not a great club europe experience
london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways  dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back
tirana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wifi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wifi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast  as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am  cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this  hours  minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we deboarded quickly i always recommend ba  and will continue to do so
gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service
london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one 
london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible im only  and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a  both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the ac both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights its not worth it
gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied
bordeaux to gatwick british airways cancelled my september  flight due to the pilots strike with advance notice i made alternative travel arrangements confirmed that i wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund and received confirmation from ba on  august  ba refunded my fare soon enough but i am still awaiting a refund for the  euro cost of baggage that i paid  six weeks later i lodged a complaint on th october no action i lodged another complaint on th october and still no action they cancelled my flight and wont refund my money and they call it customer service

london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack  months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on  aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats c and d on arrival at checkin one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at checkin started quoting the ‘geneva convention’ that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with  minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary don’t trust ba with your loved ones care
london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy ba’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again
san jose to london the tv screen of f was broken could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the back of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husband in e and me turned in the breakfast cards together the flight attendant insisted they don’t have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast  flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed
london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane   f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy
flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly
we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth
i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive  hour  minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about  hour and  minutes of wait
zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are  empty rows either side of  strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink
san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at  per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints
london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process ieby group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba
london gatwick to salzburg with british airways worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told its not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home
frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be done far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities
hyderabad to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details bank address etc required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary
vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the  business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair  on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a  hours trip  no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better
london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at  pm and took off at  stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes  additional seats are replacing the  toilets located at the back of the  and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price
brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about  were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators 
my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than  minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back i never saw the crew member again 
kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant  i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said “like an ipa” i answered “yes”  i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me
london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great  ab good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already preordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late  minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after  hours of sleep
edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over it took  minutes before my bag came through the baggage claim service desk turned away  other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another  days hoping that british airways would help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent basically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost  for new tickets to get home spent the next  hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again
amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at  am local time and arrives in only  hours to london this is a very good product
london to athens british airways is a glorified budget airline a hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an ms inflated price sandwich is the meal no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in  yet they charged fullservice airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided
terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was  hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food i will never fly british airways again  stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline
buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money 
mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service it’s almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights
great all round ba  october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldn’t ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich
flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag
flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent  looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline
johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at pm the following night at  pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported  hours previously finally departed at pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam  hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking
dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i dont know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product
istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch
yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service
flight from london to athens with british airways was one of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have gone no frills and airline has become a bad quality budget airline sad avoid
short  minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time
calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldnt be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a  hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips
for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to it’s poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba  from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over  hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it’s customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again
austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing  after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel you’re in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect
london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement  separate toilets from economy  dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service  a better nd meal  the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again  yes definitely
i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is  hr my flight layover in london was hrmin british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering  minutes more than london’s minimum hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a nofrills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise
one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba don’t tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities it doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour
gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight  sept i gave ba almost  out of  across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight  sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait  minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldnt have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork
vancouver to london great flight on the superb a in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin  though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended
gatwick to alicante  hours  hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last  months  vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under ft tall
we have had some torrid experiences with ba  which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’ sadly the current ceo doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic
london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a  to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from  hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that
i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £ more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded £ of the £ i had paid the £ difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me  weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the £ i never received the refund 
the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by  minutes once airborne in a refitted a complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadnt extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight  and a first for me  was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast  although at a cost of £ for an hours use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport  minutes later so not too bad all in all
chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at  pm chicago time but was scheduled at  pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at  pm we managed to board on the a for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at  am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at  pm we had to wait  hours for boarding for another  minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a at  pm zurich time instead of the original  pm very stressful at least the staff were nice
glasgow to london smooth flight departurearrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had preordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadnt provided any so they said  but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight
having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the checkin and security clearance at t took only  minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not  confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system  to  which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again im not a fan of this possibly due to the previous days strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room im mcm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only  minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were  cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe  in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than  minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was  minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only  border police carrying out immigration controls for over  passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further  minute wait for luggage but this was not bas fault
i wouldnt even rate them   x business class passengers booked via on business  bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive  most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds  ok thats a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhrmxp for  days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo  director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering £ evoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again
flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline yet it charges full service prices
los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge  it took us  min to find two chairs to seat food was  awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of  plus fee change so we ended up paying  per person in addition to the fare already paid 
phoenix to tel aviv via london the return from london to phoenix was a nightmare i want everyone to know that i sent a complaint  times but there is no one to talk to this is not something that i am used to
london to kefalonia  the t galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at  on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting  minutes in a queue and then  minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that we’d be waiting on a stand for  hr  minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only  minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport  minutes later overall a typical ba experience that’s lacklustre at best
london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my bag did not make it on the flight i then flew with british airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using american’s baggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession ba’s customer service is terrible if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city i’m in for more than a day and i can’t get it talk about serious frustration i don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told “we are not authorized to call airports” why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed don’t expect any help if you flew with ba and here’s a tip if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will get a lot more information and assistance that way 
hong kong to london an email on the th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely  but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home
gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay gbp because one of the suitcases was cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight
london to abujaflight full aircraft an older version of  evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja return flight delayed  pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos  and had to be flown back to abuja with a  hour delay flight was supposed to be a  am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane  they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improvedscrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow full credit to the crew  cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel  the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the floor was visible
london to bangkok what an awful plane seats are just about ok going coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat really uncomfortable the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about  films rubbish took  hours to get the screens to actually work the plane looks old and tired not a pleasure to travel on this plane
belfast to san francisco via london checkin at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed within just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request the galleries lounge in terminal  at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and would recommend british airways
london to gothenburg ba are getting a lot of bad press  deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches baggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a pushed back m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a on time departure and early arrival at t again good crew will be flying with ba again in december strikes permitting still recommended by me as the national carrier
orlando to gatwick terrible flight experience bed bugs in old club world seats missed meals poor service complaints is outsourced to a german company who arent even part of ba  do not fly ba and club world is a waste of money
mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about  minutes don’t know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasn’t especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didn’t ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a so tight
glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at  boarded with doors closed by  bug did not depart till  due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed  days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on  which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience
orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty  drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar only one drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service
london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service the children’s meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why don’t you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the  is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad
london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to  over the last years from  at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was halfempty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the money
sydney to london via singapore with british airways i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight  the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes and maybe other vegetables i am not sure for one meal and an ice cold frittatasandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took one bite and couldnt continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class with the price difference to match of course the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights paid for inflight wifi for an a hour  disconnected after  minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed
london to johannesburg british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in  my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically  yes thats the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september  coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to  in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the  we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to  on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september  because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware
i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as i’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience
i had a stress free journey with my  yr old autistic son and  yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport #happyautism# thank you
edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday th august  at  i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i didnt quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey one of the best on board experiences i have had 
i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on  business class once at lcy my early pm flight appeared as cancelled a state of confusion broke out at the airport with people trying to find alternatives however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight on a busy day i waited for hours at the airport the new flight was displayed as “delayed” for mins the delay kept on increasing with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after pm i kept on waiting the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well result half a day wasted at lcy i feel that ba’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately delays and cancellations can happen however i have been flying ba   times a year and the  of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately especially tofrom amsterdam and germany also the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition provide what is strictly required by the law only if customers complain taking as long as possible that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer whether you are a frequent flyer or not
i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british airways for  feb  on the day of travel a few hours before the departure time i realized that i would not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation when i arrived home i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund i understood that my ticket was a nonrefundable one but it says on the ticket that surcharges taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least  euro however all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful  euro i have been trying to speak to british airways on twitter many times over the past few months and they never responded positively only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change british airways is being dishonest and should be avoided
london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal  was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished  hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great
i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help i recently flew to london from chicago they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over  hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for  days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you they do not you cant find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you
good morning i would like to write a review for british airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my  year old son and my  year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight back i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the phone they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible
my flight was cancelled  days in a row was flying out on thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with ba i got a flight out saturday night with swiss air they on the other hand actually fly and on time everything about the customer service customer relations has been terrible hours of waiting on the phone no answers on email my other flights with ba this year has been delayed too they have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of  first  days then  bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet so far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to caa and the danish aviation authority
hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on th august on nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to th august  instead of  and we could not correct it by ourselves on rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at  pm on the th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the th how come it would disappear on the th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day  of our trip
london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the  we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of  business class but  of the  seats did not operate  no headphones socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel
inflight crew were very helpful polite and caring though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines it was quite pleasant the food and drink selection was pretty basic however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost  found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding upon approaching the ba counter the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain  neither any empathy nor any willingness to help
from toronto to pisa british airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family  people ranging from  to  years from terminal  to terminal  escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we would have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived  minutes before the time
a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about  minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a to and airbus a we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probably because the plane was relatively new the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios it isnt that bad as it was only to europe an overall very good experience on board this flight
this was the worst experience i have ever had flying there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our bags from american airlines aa verified that they delivered the bags to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london the bags did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our bags i left a earphone hard case on the plane but your lost and found never answered to file a claim your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing on the return flight from london to newark your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock with an experience like this on our first vacation to london i would do everything to never fly british airways again
london to larnaca new aneo  hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my money the staff was friendly but spending money on a  hour flight on such a small plane doesnt worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration 
gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and bas check in at orlando was quick and easy
london to munich the plane is a the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided
london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on 
the seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines the seats are aging and uncomfortable the forwardbackward configuration is the most stupid i have seen the cabin had  seats to a row and about  people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck  hours ahead of the flight 
no problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways
malaga to london heathrow  a shambolic airline rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga ba sent warning of the  hour delay just before the late boarding began  sophisticated it setup they have club europe meal remains a big cutback from  despite what ba claim cabin staff were bored from the start and despite  serving in club cabin the service was very poor arrived heathrow at  and then sat waiting  mins for ground staff to show up  simply appalling trip and truly ripped off
sydney to singapore extremely disappointed trip they are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can’t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected us badly no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
london heathrow to inverness having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on  after shortnotice cancellation which i had to wait over a day for  was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go eventually got off the plane to utter chaos  mixed messages being given by ground crew some people given details about rebooking others given nothing some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels  however some people were only given one bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers utterly appalling now i’m hoping against hope i might make it home today  days after setting off
heathrow to glasgow again flight is delayed it’s easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service
a supremely awful experience from beginning to end flight to vancouver delayed by  hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between only told once on board what the problem was delays at baggage reclaim meant i didn’t get out of vancouver airport until after midnight originally scheduled to arrive pm this affected a camping trip the booking for which could not be changed flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane due to it faults none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the  hour flight food was awful and we got a choice of one meal spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled queued for hours to get some information from someone they rebooked me on a flight for  hours later without checking this was ok  only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass this means i’ve missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses  a lot of money coming out of my account whilst i wait for this now i’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me  i have to wait at baggage reclaim and see if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings back with me these are merely the most significant issues there were more and i’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided between this massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business
british airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game
london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael crofts review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the lowcost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top
palma to london heathrow how does british airways get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff  management these issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in   let alone try to make himself look all ecofriendly with such comments i have been a loyal customer for over  years and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now my patience has run out 
london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation  presumably because the striking staff didnt turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was basic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet
london to faro we booked our tickets family of  two months before the flight with british airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seats has been booked and paid quite high amount for  seats for the row  and  outbound flight row  and  two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british airways weve found out that our seats has been moved to unlucky  inbound and to a  outbound theyve split all family quite far away apart from each other as well customer service has hang up on us for the first time and second phone call has promised to call back but never did will i ever over pay £ difference so i can have good customer service with british airways ever again  the answer is no  i am extremely upset that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airways
calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation
london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to baggage drop it was quick and worked well our bag was  kg maximum is  kg so we had to take  kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it wasnt a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in h m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats  def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a so there was no ife we had a  hour delay from the bad airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and wasnt too expensive we didnt buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off  hour late and we went home the verdict is that british airways are pretty good despite the delay
nice to kuwait via london my flight from nice was delayed in the plane for  hours and in delayed in heathrow for  hours when we finally left the plane there were no information on how i get another connecting flight since due to the delay i had to miss it then i had to pass through immigration which lasted for  hours there was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us now it was am with no one to speak too and i still dont have my bags i had to grab a taxi to sleep ba didnt not provide a hotel stay i i then had to leave the apartment at  am to get to the next flight with kuwait airways
buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew back from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess amelia who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen 
hong kong to london heathrow this is a long haul flight operated by boeing er the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat this negatively affects the legroom the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television they provide dinner and breakfast for me it is quite abundant but not very delicious
what happened to a great airline got to heathrow  hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only  operators and then after  minutes a rd appeared  minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through there was  operator on this line and it took another  minutes waited over  hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over  minutes no bag got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been  members of staff at bag claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least  times to book but website does not process speak to ba at st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the  bags stated on web as  bags ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas  hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until  hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good
london heathrow to malaga in business class full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight held in the airbridge for  mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why on boarding  cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers  not a great start usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money the breakfast standards full english are about the same as a charter flight standard and despite what ba shout about this has gone through some considerable cost cutting ba can perform well on a good day but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day  are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front which was a shocker
i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the  aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace 
seattle to durban via london on th of july i arrived late just before departure time hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents when i was rushing back to the security i met the  lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in durban as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in durban on my arrival in durban i got all my bags including my back pack i would like to say thank you to the british airways staff especially the  lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i didnt get their names i was panicky thank you so much
london heathrow to austin  hour flight in a boeing  noisy cabin tiny screens collapsing headrest chocolate on my seat selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi poor food with choices running out
mykonos to london flight delayed and waiting to depart they are not on time be prepared to miss your connections take off  hours late the staff is some of the worst i have had on airlines you may be stuck on the runway and they won’t offer you any water  the worst business class experience i have had 
johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row  as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £ per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a x configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard but since it took only  minutes to board a rather full  it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africas busiest air route for the price paid id be happy to fly them again
grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter  previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room  i am a slim ft  and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was  it is now  we were sat in the  outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become  we sat in a  which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights  edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity
prague to london a two hour flight on th july was delayed by  hours with no heads up given by ba there was no sympathy or compensation  especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel 
london to dubai lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats then it would be perfect thats my only note
tel aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on  flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on  flights i havent travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class from start to finish it was a shambles  i was sent to the wrong baggage drop then to the wrong lounge i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this
the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for  minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies  the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected  a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight  a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks
stockholm to london worst business class flight i have flown split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked the meal was inedible for me and was the worst airline meal i have been served 
seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight no drink no snack no bottle of water was offered no amenity kits when i asked they said none were left in stock they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush which was ok and fast track invitation which was useless since no fast track is offered to british passports i was not given a menu i even had to ask for it i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping ok fine but even when i was awake no one bothered to ask me about the meal i had to ask for the menu a bottle of water and the meal and after all no apologies from the staff too many people are squeezed into business class even though i could lie down  degrees i had very little space at my seat given the very expensive fare i expected a much better service for business class passengers im very disappointed and will never use it again i wont recommend british airways business class to anyone
premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food i use this term lightly wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok not really a saving grace one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didn’t bother trying it the look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother which in comparison to the outbound flight london to orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldn’t happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you don’t have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it
lisbon to london business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat no leg room for me meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class all that was left was cod freezing cold but no blankets poor staff spent most of the flight apologising never fly british airways 
heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to  days to think about it
madrid to london with british airways there is nothing left of business class on these flights when they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window see picture and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage just a backpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class ridiculous service so not worth the x cost that a business class ticket goes for feel totally ripped off
gatwick to glasgow awful experience our flight arrived over  hours late at pm so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute british airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn’t their fault
frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partners bag for around  mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while  actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only  minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost  hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time
london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed getting to sardinia and so we waited but following checkin at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and we’re now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than  hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be they need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
rotterdam to london city after waiting for  hours at rotterdam airport delays i was told they rerouted my flight to amsterdam and that i needed to quickly catch a taxi that i have to pay for from rotterdam to amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there as i worried i wouldn’t make it i asked to be put in a hotel  fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked there was no apology no offer of a bus or taxis to those rerouted to amsterdam and throughout the process  long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening had i known we’d be rerouted to amsterdam i would’ve left rotterdam earlier rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end what a waste of time energy  money and no apology to make up for the hours or delay it’s quite unbelievable 
return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by  mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented
barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within  minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were  from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta it’s all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for  hours they reappeared about  minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served  our flight out  days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on
i would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba from london heathrow to singapore on  june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax  enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british airways
madrid to london heathrow this was my second trip madrid to london on british airways since may on this trip like the previous the plane broke down and we waited  hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was  degrees the cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar only ba could try to make money out of one of its technical failures i then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase as im a silver card holder i could access their business lounge in madrid i regret using it fortunately this was my last ever trip on ba
ba heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon
hamburg to abu dhabi via london heathrow initial flight from heathrow to abu dhabi was cancelled had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well service with not a free glass of water on the first leg abu dhabi to london delayed by over hrs a generous dirham  voucher £ received from ba which was enough for a bottle of water or a coffee 
new york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about  minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal # i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous”  which came across to me as inappropriate i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a  seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird  sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very basic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the bathroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been done away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied  no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate  a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a  seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither  the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a nonstop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxietyinducing
london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we would definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came back with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special
gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this highcost route the pillow is fabulous gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use  for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming
london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal  was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within  minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip
ba  and  return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a on both legs sat in row  outbound  rows behind club europe sat in row  on the return leg room seemed tighter than row  the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didn’t bother with the new ms on board service outward but did on the return the ms sandwich was everything you would expect from an ms sandwich apart from the cost but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the  cabin crew the best part of  minutes to get from row  to row  the other  members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just  passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about  minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to also a queue of  or  passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they would not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr
heathrow to kalamata heathrow t to kalamata greece th june and return  week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news  took off   hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about  hour on the journey out also left kalamata about  hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jetcom so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course ms offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fas so all in all decent flights havent used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right
london to gothenburg unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess extra visa checks passport checks separate queues additional controls heathrow terminal  is the most bizarre
amsterdam to london on th april i arrived  hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delaywhen i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person everyone had made it before me my bags were already offloaded she continued to say  after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me 
istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a neo the aircraft is set up with the first  rows of regular seats and the remaining  rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however  hours  minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after  hours the  members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products
i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me  days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for  people by £ and seats were only booked on the lhrkul and return kullhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an  hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing  but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited  times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing  has no way of changing the airflow to your seat
london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment 
london to seoul nightmare experience with british airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a  hours longhauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take
london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame flew back premium class more room i probably won’t use them in november when i go back timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didn’t get a headache
newcastle to delhi via london at checkin  i was charged for carrying  kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of £ for  kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget   hours into the  journey my inflight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking 
miami to delhi via london  the ba business class i flew for the first time recently was the worst i have  flown whereas most have four seats across british airways has eight the lay down beds are hard thin and short not worth the money
london to sydney via singapore checked in with a bag which was kg my allowance was kg i was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage really i found the food on both legs of the flight horrible
phoenix to amsterdam via london it was  hrs on a delayed flight in a cramped seat with no lights no call light no entertainment of any sort and food i found exceptionally bad the b that was terribly maintained the offer of gbp for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety
standard run of the mill airline for todays economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to bacom and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere  points my balance is around  
belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t checkin was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i wasnt an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about  minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and barebones as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as were used to getting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded userunfriendly t although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as deltas the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible we were given halfsandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the  was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t
buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my back while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful
london to nashville the worst airline transatlantic despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville british airways ruined this trip the flight was delayed by over three hours whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing  from san jose the airplane was filthy dirty in club class which is bad enough having to suffer the awful dated club class yingyang facing narrow seats with divider business class on british airways is the worst of any airline the wifi was out of service on late arrival in nashville my luggage arrived soaking wet and i was unable to change clothes on my return to the uk i contacted british airways customer relations to seek compensation and got the usual pathetic mainly computer generated insincere apology i am now forced to haggle with british airways and endure their woeful socalled customer relations department it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier british airways treat their premium class customers with contempt this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow 
flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing  that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness
just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba the check in process was disgusting  minutes queuing  ba staff working in two desks one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers she seemed to take an eternity in the  minutes it took us the queue never dropped below about  people i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk the adjacent jet desks had seven staffed desks and i counted  staff the “welcome” sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait” to cap it all after enduring the queue we’re now delayed  minutes thus far so unprofessional
gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase it didn’t arrive  i was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by  pm i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadn’t been delivered the next morning sunday i phoned the number again the answer message said phone back on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at  pm my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there
my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is  each and there’s a  fee for them to do it over the phone that’s  and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid  to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event the flight was delayed and arrived hr  mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight
i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldnt fit the bag in the space remaining so they kept the bag on my laptop bag when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down  i was travelling with only one laptop bag placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this 
london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this one was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved 
london heathrow to dubai last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought 
london to seattle my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb i’d like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed
johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat together when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you get advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because one of us was ill 
london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i didnt use flight departed  minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate  minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed  minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer  outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights
the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older  with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pretake off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba yingyang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle  centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight  very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of  starters  mains and  sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite rundown escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only one other arrival but we still waited over  minutes for luggage to come through
london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy more on that in the seat review again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls
cpt is definitely getting its act together bas galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world thats despite the ancient yinyang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw soft design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the triple bread roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down  minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience
sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front  service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a bad delay on the belfast flight  we were not allowed to reenter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had gone through security  only after  minutes were we allowed to reenter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted  hours  minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the hour flight from sofia  i will never set foot on this airline again 
lima to gatwick helpful and courteous cabin crew  the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory the screen was small and in poor condition movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally without warning increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset a  hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system
inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways service was very good but comfort was very bad for a  hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights
i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steakveg fruits  was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cerealyoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf  from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am  with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight
flight was ok minor delay didnt both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight
gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wifes remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wifes wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor
marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal  at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal  where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me 
the cabin crew on flight ba london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i would write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks
gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldn’t expect this and i’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus
boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a for the first time paid a steep  for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard one comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best  not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b  flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however was a disaster none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher 
london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new soft product still unfortunately a  yearold  that hadnt had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door thats falling off its hinges a nontouch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that wont stay shut dont pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the onboard service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same lowres screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its longinthetooth first class when their new club suites are launched
this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba  from jfk new york to heathrow on tue th may i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with  girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hours delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldnt do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on
london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group  i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate bags i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance 
gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens one hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers don’t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets
i paid an extra £ for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i would be happy to pay for their premium seats i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of £
faro to heathrow flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster we fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it same happened on flight out too it is a shambles and a disgrace waited  mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again avoid at all costs
vancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best
gatwick to tenerife all so wrong lounge really overcrowded  food on the plane pretty horrid left most of it paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner  this is normal procedure apparently on top of a £ six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner  total madness this is an airline with a self destruct button such a shamehave just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires did not even bother to look at ba
washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on  first class i wasnt overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldnt have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hilight of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training
rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed back early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight
london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took  hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off  the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before i’d even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after i’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that i’ve given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well  the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though  sorry ba not good enough
their customer service is horrible lost our bags here we sit in london after  days of wearing the same clothing we fly out in  hours to barcelona for a  day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go i spent so much  on this trip to celebrate my husbands th birthday and our th wedding anniversary it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime we have really been trying to make light of things but not getting our bags today as its now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle is heartbreaking not one single person at british airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy for that matter one customer service agent even asked me if we would be ok getting out to heathrow to pick them up truly the worst customer experience ive had
london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around  times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around  minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew
i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport they informed us that the flight will be delayed for  hours from am to pm then another  hour and a half until  pm we lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it i understand that unforeseen situation can happen but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life
london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba  april   his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight 
vancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them 
miami to london heathrow with british airways top deck of  with one experienced and one new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected ontime arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers
houston to london the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem i’ve no problem with that i like travelling safely i thought well i’m sure i’d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water explaining the problem he fetched me a sandwich and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen later when the liquid refreshment cane round both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it
london to delhi the worst business class trip for us seats much smaller than business class on singapore air thai international eva air qantas not seated together  same surname mr and mrs  but moved after no privacy on middle seats one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes ipad makeup and sponge bag book etc filmtv selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working the food was very poor  main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic no tea coffee or chocolates offered to us breakfast had no jam with the croissant nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages the crew didn’t put themselves out if one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it i would never choose to travel ba again
bucharest to london my flight with british airways was  hours delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i was informed that under eu regulations i would receive  euros compensation to be informed  days later that this was an error and that i was no longer getting compensated british airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight however there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy i believe that if not on legal basis british airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a  hour delay within europe is significant many times i picked to fly with british airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that its not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airways
london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle i was on a seat next to the aisle we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter 
madrid to london we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats the original booking was from iberia part of iag which operates ba iberia and air lingus ba clearly do not integrate into iberias systems since after paying for and closing our seats upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba these flights were operated by iberia and ba ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow ba explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund  total joke since we paid for the seats additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice well accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag  ba has let the customer down again just simply poor ba  and low bar as always expected more for full fare business class rated  since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats
dublin to london heathrow british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the checkin lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed ontime and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the  thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable
london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe ba is the only one flying s to europe from seattle overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum  upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum  no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do get it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck  i hope ba will improve their act i certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future
london to gibraltar check in at t was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar a good flight
london to boston ba replaced a with a very old boeing  video system did not work for more than  hour then work for a few hours and stopped working no wifi very old plane service ok not good for business traveling
london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area  if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately  but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage
london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well done ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful
larnaca to london this a is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid € for my flight its disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than  hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat its a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing 
i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added  times during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reasons the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i would have had to pay about thirty pounds the checkin area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the checkin agent was very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly
the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare checkin was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty  some of the to buy ms food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the dropdown route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew
london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing  on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable
bridgetown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests he’d been forgotten i requested ‘express’ service which didn’t happen website advertises ‘premium levels of service’ and ‘every journey unique and unforgettable’ the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons don’t waste your money with this airline you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you don’t pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really
st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £ per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article  of ec  stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat ba’s latest advert celebrates  years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article  of ec regulation  is worth reading if this happens to you
chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldn’t check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in  hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldn’t allow me to do this
london to bangalore this was the worst experience i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter i found the food portions so meagre not sufficient for a child also  british airways is sad in every sense of the term
hamburg to abu dhabi via heathrow the h flight from hamburg to heathrow was like flying a budget carrier no free service at all everything has to be purchased at inflated prices heathrow t the usual chaos i can use the f lounge due to my one world status massive lounge crowded with the charm and food quality of a cafeteria toilets filthy one of the worst lounges i’ve seen boarding orderly and well organized boeing  ife screen broken seats very uncomfortable and narrow service and food quality average flight abu dhabi to heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew this is something i have never experieinced before rest of the journey uneventful overall a rather disappointing experience ba cannot compete with the middle eastern carriers
london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning however it’s great to see ba treat their customers with care
doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october  nothing has changed  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of  bags  kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class
madrid to london ba on the  couldnt have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well done to the crew on that flight
on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon thanks the return felt like a  hour easyjet flight one meal and one half meal limited drinks very small seats i’m  foot  and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre
london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british airways tradition  friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older  ife selection good
the first class zone at heathrow t and the concorde lounge are very good service on board was excellent in both directions the cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about the screen is small with poor resolution i enjoyed the flights in both directions mainly because of the service this first does not compare well with that of middle eastern and asian airlines but ba business class is so poor i either fly economy or when i am very lucky try to fly first
i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago i had requested a special meal but that was not available when i complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering  k miles the bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest video screen is small and must be stowed away  min before landing cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button in flight entertainment is poor 
leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £ on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about £ the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over £ when i indicated one checked bag i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and one bag included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was nonresponsive 
dallas to london heathrow in first class this is the worst experience i have had on a flight the crew was indifferent and unresponsive and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers this was nothing but a waste of money i doubt very much i will go back to british airways again
tenerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around  degrees leg room is also non existent ms food ran out halfway through the  hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals cant fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous its clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory
heathrow to larnaca  departed on time flight nearly full ms food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle larnaca to heathrow  two messages received while in larnaca airport  the flight would be delayed by over an hourdeparture was supposed to be at  pm but we took off nearer to  pm the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us the flight was  hours longso this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable  worse than a budget airline a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a balance problem in addition i was incorrectly charged eur  on the return leg for my case  it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers the only saving grace was the cabin crewparticularly the customer service managerwho promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout how british airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me
los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the  ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight  if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the xx layout is one too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways if you have an aisle seat in the turn right section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally by economy section passengers with their carryons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone thanks also to two people most of us forget  the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow  minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well done ba for providing such a good product and service
london to phoenix ba yesterday the plane was supposed to land at  however it landed at  because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario california aboard american airlines by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage it was already  the flight departs at  i went to the ground crew of american airlines they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway they then directed me to british airways i went to the ground attendant of british airways and she told me to go back to american airlines to get it re booked i went back to american airlines then they told me again to back to british airways since they are they the one who caused the delay i went back to british airways with the american airlines supervisor the british airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning she did not offer any explanations or anything american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation i ended up getting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines
san francisco to london after paying £ for flights which i had to cancel they wouldnt allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldnt give me the  avios points because i wont be on the flight
rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use checkin procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they don’t serve anything free on all european routes
cologne to gatwick in economy class with an silver status ba card no online checkin available  ba website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport  hours before flight departure but airport checkin the only available option starts  hours before departure no lounge available there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers except ba no priority boarding for business and elite level passengers boarding the plane by bus not even free water on board in economy
tampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldnt let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they cant do anything and i cant get on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and wont reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received 
london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler ive been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal  is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available im very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways keep it up guys
gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a th birthday celebration tickets bought in august  and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that wed been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way back to london exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service  days later ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats ba has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you get charge £ to pre reserve in club and £ in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you dont deserve to stay in business
its been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but thats all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants couldnt do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it on the way back i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and get it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though im ft ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder
london heathrow  pisa return my wife and i fly this route  times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £ return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two  with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad  wine on the way back  a ploughmans lunch it was okayish as a  year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the us japan and the middle east  and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest plcs in the country  i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year oh what a surprise and thats the clear objective of the directors so what would i do with club europe id make it the best in europe the seat would be larger like an arm chair a  configuration there would be a nice centre table charge ports for phoneslaptops headsets tv screens mainly for news  but some movies for flights over  hours extra  of leg room behind row  nice cutlery and glasschina ware hot meals and id probably sell it at £ a flight more build value guys and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way back on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off  hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good
edinburgh to boston via london the planes are ancient and need to be replaced if these were cars they would have an antique plate the seats are uncomfortable and worn there is no lumbar support the space between the seatback in front and your face is inches it’s really claustrophobic the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice so for  each we had horrible seats and terrible food the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water the ms menu is expensive and offers limited choices meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good there was one member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board british airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing
gatwick to mauritius my wife and  friends booked and paid £ each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter trading standards are also being informed it didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by  hours on the outward leg was filthy dirty the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues i am a licensed engineer a marketing email in celebration of  years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return british airways you are a disgrace get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for
flew out of heathrow on nd feb to new york  mins into our flight and we noticed our tvs werent working  travellers but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight
horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return i am only  st  and i find the leg room too cramp the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time it was probably in the last  hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop the food was barely edible coming back on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off this was the worst flight i have flown on last long haul ba flight for me
new york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow  quick mediocre food service then gone chair is set up so i’m staring at a stranger it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didn’t wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now i’m on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just  seats with the middle one blocked out person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest i didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for  long flights i won’t fly ba again 
chicago to london heathrow club class on british airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry  it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes circa  year old bs but they perpetuate the dreadful yingyang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then midflight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passengerno mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible breakfast was inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at ohare was a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese insufficient chairs and a single old tv does no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers
london to chicago could it get any worse the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing  the british airways first class product doesnt come up to modern business class standards this particular flight was late again and the food  wine was simply awful there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class and the crew demonstrate no sophistication this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain finally not only is the aircraft tired and worn out but the in flight socalled entertainment system did not work and had to be rebooted twice the first class seat is a bad joke and extraordinarily uncomfortable british airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product all that can be said about this airline is woeful the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty and desperately needs refurbishment
prague to london heathrow very disappointing service cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin on a two hour flight that was already delayed  payment machine was broken staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley on the bright said i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices
london city to florence my flight was at around am in the morning not only it got canceled  hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldn’t select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find  book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with £ more of course why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page 
london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i would love a gt to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure pm is not late for me and that no predinner drinks would be served i insisted this is business class after all half full flight  minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it gt first dish main dish and dessert  never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until  hours before landing  other passengers in business where treated the same and complained
doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and bad still with ba  bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival  leathery and inedible  why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering  hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand
miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october  what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february  calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees 
london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it hadnt been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work
london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge galleries north  was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world  weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight
san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at  the crew had one interest and one only  to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket  so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i wasnt offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they werent interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us  mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline
gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system always hit or miss before and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience i will consider them in the future much improved well done
london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly
london to tampa ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss i just got a new one the new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad so on top of the new suitcase i had to actually pay ba to check the new bag cost me over  for their mistake they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad you will get an email a month later saying id like to know you that we are unable to offer refund make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service

my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the th february  every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer the plane was shabby and dated the seat reclining facility did not operate properly was not that comfortable and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly one ear bud on the headphones did not work the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the inflight entertainment which in itself had a dated choice the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew they were abrupt unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there there was one exception an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth coordination when distributing the meals our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or reassure them british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option
bridgetown to gatwick i couldnt imagine that first class on ba would be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar emirates etihad singapore thai etc for double the price cabin seats and food equals business class one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service but first class on ba is not worth the fare when i complained to customer service after i got home all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller 
london to athens classic ba love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster problems in december  at heathrow checkin when ba checkin and baggage management it systems went down for at least  minutes total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport  hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving  minutes prior to their departure and given priority even though we were checked in at some point the flight was delayed by  hours on top of the problems then flight does not have enough food onboard at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum
i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth checkin and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused us already about  mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after  mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after  or  hours the flight was full of overseas travellers we spent  hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane  times in total and no food or water was offered to us we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london
flying premium economy on british airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again
tokyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing  we had a good checkin experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing  were good a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifullypresented japanese starter followed by a bentostyle lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passengers footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight
london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated checkin area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it didnt feel like a longhaul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep
i was flying london to billund today via british airways and i was a bit hesitant as i’ve never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a kg bag to also check in and check in closed  mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could get to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british airways like no other and i’m very grateful
